This Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack in Adigrat, Tigray region, is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates as; “Adigrat! It has been reported that the drone struck selected military positions in Adigrat starting at 4 AM.”
As seen here and here, similar claims containing the same image were also shared on Facebook by other social media users.
An image of a drone is attached to the post to support the claim. However, results of a Google reverse image search established that the picture under investigation is unrelated to the claim.
The picture was shared on the Addis Standard verified Twitter account along with other photos on 12 September 2018, with a caption that reads: “Test trial of drones designated to deliver medical supply, including blood & emergency medical equipment, took place today. The drones can carry up to 5 kg, can fly up to 5000 m altitude, cover a distance of 300 kms at a time & withstand various weather types.”
The same image was published on other websites in 2018, as seen here and here.
Although the image does not show a drone attack in Adigrat, reports indicate that twin drone attacks killed 10 people in the Tigray region on 14 September 2022.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack in Adigrat, Tigray region, and finds it to be FALSE.
