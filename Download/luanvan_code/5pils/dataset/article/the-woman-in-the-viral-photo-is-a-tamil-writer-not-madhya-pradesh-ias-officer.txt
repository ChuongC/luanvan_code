An image depicting a woman seated beside an elderly man is being widely shared on social media. The post claims that the woman is an IAS officer from Madhya Pradesh and that she has realized her father’s dream of travelling in an aeroplane, given that he worked as a truck driver. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of an IAS officer from Madhya Pradesh with her father on a flight.
Fact: The woman in the Image is not an IAS officer. Her name is Pon. Vimala. She is a Tamil writer and is currently working as Executive Director of Colors TV Tamil. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
Conducting a reverse image search on the viral image led us to the same image in a Linkedin post shared by a woman named Vimala Pon two years ago. In this post, Vimala identified herself as the woman in the picture and mentioned that her father (the elderly man in the image) was a truck driver. She expressed that her childhood dream was to take him on a plane, and she accomplished this aspiration at the age of 38 after joining Colors TV Tamil.
Upon comparing other visuals (here, here & here) of Vimala Pon with those of the viral image, it becomes evident that the woman depicted in the viral image is the Tamil Writer Vimala Pon. According to her LinkedIn profile, she has been serving as the Executive Director of Colors TV since 2017 and is not an IAS officer.
To sum it up, the Woman in the viral photo is a Tamil Writer and not an IAS officer from Madhya Pradesh.
