This Facebook post with an image claiming to show a Sudanese military helicopter collecting bodies of soldiers killed by Fano commandos is FALSE.
The Amharic text accompanying the image translates into; “The hero Fano Commando knocked down seven Sudanese soldiers like a snake and the Sudanese military helicopter collected their corpses and left.”
Fano is an armed youth movement in the Amhara region state of Ethiopia.
On 26 June 2022, Sudan accused the Ethiopian army of executing seven Sudanese soldiers and a civilian. Both the soldiers and the civilian were captives. Ethiopia denies the accusation and, instead, blamed the killings on a local militia.
Nevertheless, the picture used to advance the claim is false. Google reverse image search results reveal that the picture is unrelated to the recent conflict between Sudan and Ethiopia.
The image shows soldiers disembarking from an Egyptian Air Force CH-47 Chinook helicopter during the “Guardians of the Nile” joint military drill between Egypt and Sudan in Um Sayyala, northwest of Khartoum, on 31 May, 2021. The image is credited to Ashraf Shazly/AFP via Getty Images
The rising tension between Sudan and Ethiopia has drawn the attention of the chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki, who has asked both countries to refrain from military escalation and to seek a negotiated position over the border dispute.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Sudanese military helicopter collecting the bodies of those killed by Fano commandos and finds it to be FALSE.
