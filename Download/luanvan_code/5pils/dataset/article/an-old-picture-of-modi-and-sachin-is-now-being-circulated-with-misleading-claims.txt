Many Facebook users are sharing a post with the picture of Sachin Tendulkar and his wife with Narendra Modi. In the post, it is claimed that Sachin Tendulkar has met Modi to show his support for BJP in the General Elections-2019. Let’s try to analyze the claims made in the post.
The archived version of the post can be found here.
Claim:  Former Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar along with his wife met Narendra Modi to show his support for BJP in the General Elections-2019.
Fact:  The picture in the post is the one taken in the context of Sachin Tendulkar briefing Modi about the release of his biopic “Sachin: A Billion Dreams”. So, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
On doing Google Reverse Image search, the picture in the post was found to be the one taken during the meeting of Sachin Tendulkar and his wife with Narendra Modi, to give information about his then-upcoming movie “Sachin: A Billion Dreams”. ‘AajTak’ has published an article regarding the same on May 19, 2017. There was no mention regarding Sachin’s support to BJP anywhere in it.
Hence, an old picture of Modi and Sachin is now being circulated with misleading claims.
