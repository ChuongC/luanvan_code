This Facebook post with an image claiming to show the MV Uhuru II ship broken into two at the Kisumu port is FALSE.
“The newly launched MV Uhuru ship accidentally breaks into two while on it’s (sic) first maiden floating exercise while being anchored in Kisumu port where it was being assembled. The ship was being touted as the first fully Kenyan built vessel. The Heavy military presence at the port restricting access to the area is a military drill thus being completely sealed off,” reads the text accompanying the image.
To advance the claim, an image of what looks like a ship broken apart at a shore is attached to the 5 August 2022 dated post.
The claim comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the Kisumu Shipyard and witnessed the floatation of the MV Uhuru II ferry wagon on 2 August 2022. The MV Uhuru II is the first ship to be built in Kenya and is set to be commissioned later in 2022.
However, a Google reverse image search of the picture in question brings up a ship-breaking yard in Gujarat, India, famous for dismantling ships and selling them for scrap.
PesaCheck has examined a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the MV Uhuru II ship broken into two at the Kisumu port and finds it to be FALSE.
