A Facebook post with an image of Ugandaâ€™s First Son, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, pouring a beer into a glass is ALTERED.
The first image is of a purported Kainerugaba pouring alcohol into a glass, and the other is of a person who has passed out.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the purported photo of Kainerugaba is doctored. The original photo was taken at the launch of a new beer by Nile Breweries in November 2019.
The image of an unidentified man lying on the stairs did not yield any results.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image of General Muhoozi Kainerugaba purportedly pouring a beer into a glass and found it to have been ALTERED.
