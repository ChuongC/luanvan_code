A Facebook post with photos claiming to show commandos of the Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) deployed in Kayunga town is PARTLY FALSE.
The images claim to show commandos armed with military tanks in Kayunga, central Uganda ahead of the expected visit to the district by National Unity Platform (NUP) party president, Robert Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine.
Bobi Wine was expected in the area to campaign for the NUP candidate in the local government by-election.
However, a Google reverse image search done on the first and second photos here and here, shows that they were taken from Somalia and not Kayunga.
The images show the Kenya Defence Forces soldiers who are part of the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom) patrolling Kismayu town, in November 2015 and were taken by Nation Media Group photographer Jeff Angote.
A Google reverse image search on the third image reveals it shows UPDF military armoured vehicles patrolling Kayunga town on 14 December 2021. The photo was first shared online by the Daily Monitor’s Twitter account.
On 14 December 2021, Kyagulanyi tweeted photos of police and military outside his home ahead of his planned campaigns for a by-election in Kayunga.
Police and the army surrounded the home of Bobi Wine, and blocked his planned travel.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with photos claiming to show Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) commandos deployed in Kayunga town in the Central Region of Uganda and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
