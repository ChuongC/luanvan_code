A Facebook post with images showing streets littered with currency notes claiming that Italians are throwing away money out of desperation, caused by COVID-19 is FALSE.
The post states that the photo is from Italy, where citizens allegedly threw their money onto the street in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic after realizing that it can’t buy good health.
Italy is one of the most affected countries in the world by the pandemic. As of April 11, the country had the highest number of COVID-19 deaths globally at 18,849, and the third highest number of confirmed cases at 147,577, behind Spain and the United States.
A reverse image search shows that the photo used alongside the post was shared in March 2019 on Imgur, an image sharing site, stating that the images were taken in Venezuela.
A fact-check by Snopes on the first image shows that it is of Venezuela’s old currency, the Bolívar Fuerte, which was replaced in August 2018 by a new currency, the Bolivar Soberano, as a result of hyperinflation in the country.
When the Bolivar Soberano was introduced, Bolívar Fuerte notes with a face value of less than 1,000 ceased to be legal tender. Venezuela ultimately withdrew the Bolivar Fuerte currency in all amounts on 5 December 2018.
The image on the right is an old one and not related to the coronavirus pandemic. The incident is from Venezuela, where a the Bicentenario Bank in the town of Merida was looted on 12 March 2019.
PesaCheck has looked into a post with an image claiming to show currency notes being thrown away on Italian streets out of desperation caused by COVID-19 infection and finds it to be FALSE.
