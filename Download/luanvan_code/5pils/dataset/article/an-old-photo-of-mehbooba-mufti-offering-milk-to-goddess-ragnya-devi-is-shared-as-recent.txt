A newspaper clip of Mehbooba Mufti offering milk at a temple is being shared on social media with the claim that says, “the world of these people has changed after article 370 got scrapped.’ Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.
Claim: A picture of Mehbooba Mufti offering milk at a temple.
Fact: This photo is from 2016, when Mehbooba Mufti visited Kheer Bhavani Mela. She offered milk to the goddess Ragnya Devi and met Kashmiri Pandits that day. Hence the claim made in the post is Misleading.
In the cutline of the photo of the news clipping, it is mentioned that Mehbooba Mufti offered her prayers at the Kheer Bhavani Mandir along with Kashmiri Pandits. Based on this, we searched the internet to learn more details about the photo. This search led us to various new articles (here and here) from 2016, in which Mehbooba Mufti was seen in the same attire and offering milk in a temple.
As per these reports, Mehbooba Mufti, the then Chief Minister of erstwhile Jammu and Kasmir state, visited the Kheer Bhavani Mandir in June 2016 and offered prayers to the goddess Ragnya Devi.
The viral post uses an old photo to claim that Mehbooba Mufti has visited the temple now. The Quint and AmarUjala also reported this event, and you can access them from here and here.
To sum up, an old photo of Mehbooba Mufti offering milk to goddess Ragnya Devi is shared as recent.
