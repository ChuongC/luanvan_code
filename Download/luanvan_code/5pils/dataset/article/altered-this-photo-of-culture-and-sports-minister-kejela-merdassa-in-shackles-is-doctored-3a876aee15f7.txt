This image on Facebook purportedly of Ethiopian Minister for Culture and Sports Kejela Merdassa, bare-chested with a shackle around his neck, is ALTERED.
The text attached to the picture translates to; “Although Menlik freed him, he chose slavery. The one who rebelled against the leader of liberation and the fanatic of slavery Kejela.”
However, Yandex reverse image search results established that the image under investigation is doctored.
The picture is created by digitally combining Kejela’s image and a sculpture on slavery.
The original photo of Kejela was published on the Ethio Fm 107.8 website on 9 June 2020.
And as seen here, here, and here, the image of the sculpture on slavery was shared on different websites.
PesaCheck has examined the image on Facebook supposedly of Ethiopia’s Culture and Sports Minister Kejela Merdassa, bare-chested with a shackle around his neck, and found it to be ALTERED.
