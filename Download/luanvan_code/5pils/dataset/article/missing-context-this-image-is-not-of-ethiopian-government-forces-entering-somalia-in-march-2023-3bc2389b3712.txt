This Facebook post with an image supposedly of Ethiopian government forces entering Somalia to fight Al Shabaab in March 2023 is MISSING CONTEXT.
The post, in Amharic, translates to; “According to an agreement between Somalia and Ethiopia, the Ethiopian army entered Somalia to fight al-Shabaab. This is happening without acknowledgement of the African Union Transitional Army. Al-Shabaab cannot be defeated by war, but by negotiation and peace. May the highest God give you wisdom for all of you. Let Saint Mary be with us in her prayer. Amen.”
There have been news reports that Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya are to send new troops to Somalia to help Somali security forces in the fight against Al Shabaab, a jihadist military group based in the Horn of Africa country.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the image is old, and does not depict March 2023 events.
The image was published on 23 May 2021 on the Garowe online website. The photo was used in an article about the Ethiopian National Defence Force taking position ahead of a planned battle with Al Shabaab militants.
The image was also published on this website on 30 November 2021 in an article with the headline, “Militants Attack Ethiopian and Somali Military Bases in Baidoa”.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with an image supposedly of Ethiopian government forces entering Somalia to fight Al Shabaab in March 2023 and finds it to be MISSING CONTEXT.
