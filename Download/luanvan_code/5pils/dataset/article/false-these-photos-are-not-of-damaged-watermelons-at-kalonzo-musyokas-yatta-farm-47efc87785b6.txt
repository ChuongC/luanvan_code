This Facebook post with photos supposedly of damaged watermelons at Wiper Democratic Movement-Kenya party leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s farm in Yatta, Machakos County, is FALSE.
The text accompanying the photo claims that demonstrators invaded and destroyed the farm.
The claim was published on 27 March 2023, as the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya coalition held mass action in Nairobi and several other parts of the country.
Musyoka is a council member of the opposition Azimio coalition led by former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, with retired President Uhuru Kenyatta as the chairperson.
On 27 March 2023, unidentified people raided Northlands farm owned by the Kenyatta family. Also raided was East African Spectre company associated with the Odinga family.
But are the photos of the damages at Musyoka’s Yatta farm?
A Google reverse image search on the photos indicates that they are royalty-free images and have been published in 2019 here and here.
Depositphotos.com credited the first image to an author named Simazoran, while istockphoto.com credited the second photo to family lifestyle, with the upload date indicating 19 August 2019.
We performed a keyword search to establish whether any credible news outlet had covered a story on the alleged invasion and destruction of Musyoka’s Yatta farm, but there was none.
Our search led us to this fact check, which also found the claim to be false.
PesaCheck has examined a Facebook post with photos supposedly of ruined watermelons at Wiper Democratic Movement-Kenya party leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s Yatta farm and finds it to be FALSE.
