A Facebook post with a photo supposedly showing the “oldest tree on earth” and claiming it is in Tanzania, is FALSE.
The post claims that the tree is 6,000 year old.
To date, no tree has been documented to be that old. The record holder for the “oldest tree in the world” is a Great Basin Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva) located in the Rocky Mountains in Nevada. The Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Service recorded this tree, nicknamed “Methuselah,” is 4,850 years old.
While baobab trees are known for their large girth, even growing to a diameter of more than 10 meters, none has so far been known to challenge the record for longevity among trees. Despite scant research about these trees, records show the oldest documented age of a baobab tree is 1,275 years old.
More recent studies quoted by the media named Panke as the oldest known baobab. Panke was a giant sacred baobab in Zimbabwe whose estimated age was estimated at 2,450–2,500 years old. Panke died shortly after being age tested as did a considerable number of the other 60 trees that were studied with the cause of their death being associated with climate change.
Using reverse image search, PesaCheck found that the image of the large baobab tree (Adansonia digitata) has been circulating online since at least 2004. Early postings indicate that the photograph was taken in Senegal, and not Tanzania as claimed in the post.
PesaCheck looked into a Facebook post with a photo showing an old baobab tree claiming it’s from Tanzania and finds it to be FALSE.
