An image of a pregnancy testing kit that a Facebook user claims reveals the father’s identity is ALTERED.
The image is a close-up of a hand holding an unbranded pregnancy test kit, showing a positive result and a picture of the supposed father.
“Ladies roundi hii hamna bahati…kudanganya hati mimba ni yangu na si yangu (Ladies, this time around your luck has run out…claiming that I impregnated you and yet it’s false),” reads the post accompanying the image.
A reverse search of the image, however, reveals that it is a stock photo of a pregnancy testing kit that was uploaded on depositphotos.com in 2012. It does not include a screen where the image of the supposed father is shown as claimed.
The technology around pregnancy testing has advanced over time to deliver more reliable results within just a few weeks of pregnancy. However, the suggestion that an all-in-one test that combines both the pregnancy and paternity results is untrue.
As of 2021, what is considered an advanced home pregnancy test uses antibodies to assess the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) found in urine.
The standard process of paternity testing involves collecting and analysing DNA samples of both the father and the child.
PesaCheck has looked into the image claiming to show a pregnancy testing kit that reveals an image of the father and finds it to be ALTERED.
