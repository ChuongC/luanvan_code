This tweet, which claims to show South African school children who died because of the Covid-19 vaccine, is FALSE.
The tweet shows two graphic pictures of prostrate children dressed in green school uniforms with the accompanying message: “13 Kids Have Died From Covid19 Vaccines at School In South Africa and no MSM News Coverage at all”.
However, the images are not of school children in South Africa.
A reverse image search shows that they are screen grabs of a video (warning: graphic content) of the aftermath of a school stampede in Kenya in 2020.
The media confirmed the incident happened at Kakamega Primary School in western Kenya on 3 February 2020.
The same video has been used in other false claims in Zambia and Nigeria.
PesaCheck has examined images purportedly of South African children who died because of Covid-19 vaccination and finds them to be FALSE.
