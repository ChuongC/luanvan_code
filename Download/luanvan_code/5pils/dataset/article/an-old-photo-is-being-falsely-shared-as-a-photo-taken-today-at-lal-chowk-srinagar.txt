A photo is being shared widely on social media with a claim that it was taken today at Lal Chowk, Srinagar. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post. 
Claim: Lal Chowk’s (Srinagar) photo taken today.
Fact: It is an old photo. The same photo can be found in various articles published before this month. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. 
When the posted photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, several news articles with the same photo can be found in the search results. It can be seen that those articles were published before this month. Those articles can be read here, here and here. The position of people and vehicles can be seen to be similar in the posted photo and the photo in the articles. So, an old photo of Lal Chowk is being shared as the photo of Lal Chowk taken today.
Also, the profile – ‘Ajit Doval’ which posted the photo on Facebook is not the official Facebook account of NSA Ajit Doval. In the About section of the profile, it can be seen that it is being maintained by Ajit Doval fans.
To sum it up, an old photo is being falsely shared as a photo taken today at Lal Chowk (Srinagar).
