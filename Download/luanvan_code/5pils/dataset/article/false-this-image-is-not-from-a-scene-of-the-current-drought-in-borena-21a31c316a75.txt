A Facebook post with an image supposedly of drought in Borena, Ethiopia, is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by an Amharic text loosely translated as; “My people Borena are suffering from drought and hunger. The cattle are dying of a lack of pasture. As Oromos, we have never been so ashamed or humiliated as this. Especially when Oromoness is being sung like this, it is unfortunate that my people are suffering from famine.”
According to Deutsche Welle Amharic and the Voice of America Amharic long drought spells in Borena have disrupted livelihoods. The reports say more than 3 million animals have died.
However, results from Google reverse search established that the image under investigation is old and is not of the drought situation in Borena.
The picture was shared on this website in 2011, in an article with the heading, “HelpAge calls for urgent support for drought-affected older people in Ethiopia.”
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image purportedly of the current drought in Borena and found it to be FALSE.
