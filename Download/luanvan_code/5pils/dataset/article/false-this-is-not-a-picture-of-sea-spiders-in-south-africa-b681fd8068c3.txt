An image claiming to be of sea spiders in South Africa is FALSE.
The photo was shared on Facebook by Myrtle Philbeck on 4 December 2022. It has since been shared on other platforms, including here, and here.
The caption states: “Sea spiders walking to the sea — Quiet Bay, South Africa”. Quiet Bay is the English translation, not official, of Stilbaai or Still Bay. Philbeck said the photo was taken by Jan Vorster.
However, the image does not show sea spiders.
Vorster did share the image on 30 November 2022, and it was taken in Still Bay. According to Vorster in the message accompanying the photo, the image is of aloe ferox.
In other similar images, Vorster said he found the aloes at the river mouth and warned against invasive species in the area.
Aloe ferox or the Cape Aloe is common in South Africa. In other images shared by Vorster, the resemblance to the plant is clearer.
Sea spiders are usually much smaller, between 1–750mm, with the larger species only occurring deep beneath the ocean.
Media outlets also reported that the images were not of sea spiders.
PesaCheck has examined an image purporting to be of sea spiders in South Africa and finds it to be FALSE.
