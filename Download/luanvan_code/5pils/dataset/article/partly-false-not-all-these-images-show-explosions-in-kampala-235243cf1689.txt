A Facebook post with images claiming to show the Kampala twin bombings is PARTLY FALSE.
At least six people died in the Kampala twin suicide bomb attack that occurred on 16 November 2021 at the Central Police Station and along Parliamentary Avenue.
Police says the deceased include three suicide bombers and three Ugandans while scores were left injured. While the police say rebel group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) was behind the attack, militant group Islamic State has claimed responsibility for both attacks.
This is in addition to three other bomb explosions that were witnessed in the country in October 2021.
The post reads “Bomb blast in Kampala, so sad” and is accompanied by images allegedly showing scenes of the incident.
A Google reverse search shows that only one of the images shows the actual scene of one of the bombings along Parliamentary Avenue as seen here.
A reverse search of the second image reveals that it was taken in Mogadishu, Somalia in 2017 after one of the country’s deadliest bomb attacks that claimed at least 300 lives. PesaCheck has also debunked a similar claim with this photo.
The third image was taken after an explosion at Ado Soba in Lagos, Nigeria caused by pressure exerted on the pipeline by a tipper laden with granite, a Google image search reveals.
PesaCheck has looked into a post with images claiming to show the Kampala twin bombings and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
