This Facebook post with an image purportedly of a bus that was burned for carrying Fano troops is FALSE.
Fano refers to an armed youth group that joined forces with Ethiopia’s federal troops as they fought the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in the Amhara region.
The image of the smoking bus is accompanied by an Amharic text that translates to; “Advise him, if he refuses, let suffering advise him.” This is a saying in Ethiopia often used to indicate that something bad will happen if one fails to follow advice.
The post calls for an apology from the bus company for carrying the Fano.
“Let it admit that it transported the Fano militia and killer troops. And it should apologise to the Oromo people. Otherwise, let it replace its name that says Oda with Tana and join them officially,” the post adds.
However, Bing’s reverse image search results established that the particular image is unrelated to the Fano group.
The picture was shared on the Addis Maleda website on 18 February 2022 in an article about a public transport bus that caught fire. The report states that the bus had 62 passengers, including university students, travelling from Addis Ababa to Dese.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show a bus that was burned for carrying Fano troops and found it to be FALSE.
