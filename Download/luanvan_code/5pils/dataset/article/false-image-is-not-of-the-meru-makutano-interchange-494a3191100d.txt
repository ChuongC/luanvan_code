A tweet with an image purportedly of the Meru-Makutano interchange that links the Mount Kenya East town to Nanyuki is FALSE.
The tweet reads: “Meru — Makutano interchange that links the town with Nanyuki. Thank you President Uhuru.” It also lists other trending topics and an image of roads intersecting.
The image has also been shared on Facebook with a similar claim.
This comes in the wake of Roads, Transport and Public Works Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen making public the details of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) elusive contract between Kenya and China. The project, which courted controversy, was undertaken during retired President Uhuru Kenyatta’s tenure.
However, while there are plans to build a dual carriage road on the Meru-Nanyuki highway with an interchange at Makutano, there are no news reports of such a completed and functional project. In fact, the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) announced a call for proposals for the construction of the road in February 2022. The project is intended to be completed in 54 months.
A Google reverse image search shows that the road is in São Paulo City, Brazil.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image purportedly of the Meru-Makutano interchange that links the Mt Kenya east town to Nanyuki and found it to be FALSE.
