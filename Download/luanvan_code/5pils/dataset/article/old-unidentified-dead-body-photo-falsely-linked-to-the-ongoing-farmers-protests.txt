A photo is being shared on social media claiming it as the picture of a farmer who died while protesting in Delhi opposing the new farm laws introduced by the Government of India. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim:  Photo of the farmer who died while protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws.
Fact: Photo shared in the photo is an old one. This photo is on the internet at least since 2018. This photo has nothing to do with the ongoing farmers’ protest against the Centre’s new farm laws. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar photo is found to be uploaded on social media by a few users during 2018 and 2019. These posts can be seen here, here and here. The posts mention that a dead body of an unidentified person aged about 70 years was found in Bohri chowk of Tar Tarn, and request everyone to share the post to ascertain the identity of the person. Though we couldn’t find any further information about the dead body, it is concluded that this photo is not of a person from the ongoing farmers’ protests as it is available on social media at least since 2018.
According to the news reports, at least 22 to 25 farmers have died during the protests against the new agriculture amendment laws passed by the Government of India. News articles and media reports about the farmers’ death in these protests can be read here, here and here.
To sum it up, an old photo of an unidentified dead body is being falsely shared linking it to the ongoing farmers’ protest.
