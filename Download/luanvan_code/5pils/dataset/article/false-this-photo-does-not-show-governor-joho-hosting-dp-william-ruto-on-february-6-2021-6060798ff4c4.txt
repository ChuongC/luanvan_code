A photo shared on Facebook claiming to show Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho hosting Deputy President William Ruto in Mombasa on February 6, 2021, is FALSE.
The photo, that shows DP Ruto together with Governor Joho and Mombasa politician Hassan Omar, in a jovial mood, is captioned: “Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho host’s (sic) Dp Ruto for dinner on his last day of three days coastal tour”.
DP Ruto held a three-day tour of the coastal region between February 4 to 7, 2021, where he visited Kwale, Kilifi and Mombasa counties.
Research by PesaCheck shows that this photo claiming to show Governor Joho hosting Dr Ruto during the deputy president’s recent tour of the coastal region is false.
Notably, the people in the image are not observing social distancing measures, neither are they wearing protective face masks, indicating this is an old picture, taken before the COVID-19 era.
A Google search shows that the photo is not from the recent DP’s tour of the coast.
A picture of the three politicians, wearing the same clothes, has been used in an October 2020 article by Nation Africa. A further search shows the picture of the three was first used online on December 21, 2018.
Further, a look at the DP’s official Twitter account — where he has posted photos from his recent tour to the coastal region — as well as Governor Joho’s account, yield no result of the image used in the claim.
Both DP Ruto and Governor Joho worked together as members of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) in 2007.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared on Facebook claiming to show Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho hosting Deputy President William Ruto in Mombasa on February 6, 2021, and finds that it is FALSE.
