A photo shared on Facebook claiming to show flooding in an estate in Eldoret town is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by a post that reads: “Eldoret town, home to the current Deputy President of Kenya”. The post is political and targets Deputy President William Ruto, blaming him for not doing enough to help his home county.
But does the photo show flooding in Eldoret town as the post claims? We checked.
A reverse image search reveals that the photo was taken in Syokimau estate in Machakos County and not Eldoret as the post claims. An article published by The Star on February 14, 2021 used the same photo with a report that the flooding was caused by heavy rains during the weekend of February 13, and 14, 2021.
This is not the first time the area has been affected by flooding. Syokimau estate, which falls under the Nairobi metropolis, is prone to flooding during rainy seasons.
PesaCheck has looked into the authenticity of a photo shared on Facebook claiming to show flooding in Eldoret town and finds that it is FALSE.
