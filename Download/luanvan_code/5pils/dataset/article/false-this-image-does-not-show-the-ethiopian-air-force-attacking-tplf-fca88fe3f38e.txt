A Facebook post claiming to show an Ethiopian Air Force jet attacking TPLF’s military training centre at a place called Raya Azebo is FALSE.
The post, in Amharic, translates, “The spectacular operation on Monday, 8 November 2021, taken by the Ethiopian air force destroyed the terrorist TPLF’s military training camp at Raya Azebo town.’’
Although the post claims the attack took place at a town known as Raya Arebo, the correct name of the town is Raya Azebo, located in the Tigray region at the eastern edge of the Ethiopian highlands.
Ethiopia has been in active war since November 2020.
On 18 October 2021 Tigrayan forces accused the Ethiopian government of launching airstrikes on the capital of the Tigray region. Although a government official initially denied that any strikes had been carried out, BBC later quoted a report from Ethiopia’s state-run media stating that the air force had conducted an attack.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image presented to support the above claim, has been in use since June 2014. The Express Tribune website published it in an article headlined “Operations updates: 22 militants Killed in Datta Khel airstrikes (Pakistan)”.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attacking the TPLF Military training center in the Raya town and finds it to be FALSE.
