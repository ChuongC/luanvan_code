This Facebook image used to advance the claim that the Ethiopian National Defense Forces disarmed the Oromia Special Forces in 2022 is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo text accompanying the image translates to; “national defense force disarmed the Special Force of Oromia while we were shouting at you. You would have been better off if you had shown priority for your community. We have already told you that you have no respect from the government. This is a great lesson for those who are passionate about the community.”
The Oromia Special Forces are the regional state security force of Oromia.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the photo is unrelated to the ENDF disarming the Oromia Special Forces.
The Independent Oromia website published the photo on 7 March 2021 in an Afaan Oromo article titled, “Many Ethiopian defense force soldiers surrender to the Oromo Liberation Army, and many are killed.”
The image was also published on this Facebook account on 2 April 2021 alongside a text that reads: “There are 15 people who have disappeared from the special forces of the Oromia Police Force in Goba town today. Be strong our Oromo Liberation Army.”
A keyword search on Google shows there are no reports of the Oromia Special Forces being disarmed by the ENDF.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image used to advance the claim that the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) disarmed the Oromia Special Forces in 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
