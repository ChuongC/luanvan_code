A claim by Juba South Sudan, that a bride ran out of the church in Juba on Monday this week after discovering that the man (Lualdit) doesn’t work for an oil company as he claimed is false.
Juba South Sudan, is an online page with a category of travel and transport. The page has 44,000 followers and over 40,000 likes.
On Monday, 26 September 2022, the page posted pictures of what looks like a bride and some people running after her seemingly to convince her to come back to church.
The pictures were captioned: “A bride runs out of church today in Juba after discovering that the man (Lualdit) doesn’t work in an oil company as he claimed. Kalam de wosulu.” The post attracted over 1,000 interactions, 823 comments and over 60 shares.

A reverse image search of the photos shared in the Facebook post indicated that the photos were infact first shared on 15th August 2016 and were traced to the Eket Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State in Nigeria.
The article associated with the image claimed that the bride ran away after she discovered the husband to be wasn’t an employee at Chevron as he had earlier claimed.
The photo was shared widely in 2016 by various websites. The photo once again surfaced in August 2021 with the same claim. 
This Nigerian website once again carried the same story but did not specify which date the incident occurred.
In September 2021 a Kenyan blogger shared the same picture of a bride running away while being followed seemingly by a bridegroom on his Facebook page with a description that a Kilifi woman ran away from her wedding after learning that the boyfriend is a taxi driver and not an employee of Kenya Commercial Bank .This was fact checked by John Mbati of Kenya.co.ke.on 23rd  Sept 2021 and the claim was dismissed as false.

In all the above articles the claim was first reported by a Facebook user Sunday Ikemefula, he says the bride ran out of the church after discovering that the groom is not a chevron staff as he claimed to be, he lied to her. According to the post it happened in Eket, Akwa Ibom State Nigeria. 
Conclusion:
211 Check has found out that the Facebook post featuring the image of a bride who appears to be fleeing her wedding and was taken in Juba to be false. The photos are of a bride who was seen running from her wedding in Nigeria, but no-one knows what really happened.
