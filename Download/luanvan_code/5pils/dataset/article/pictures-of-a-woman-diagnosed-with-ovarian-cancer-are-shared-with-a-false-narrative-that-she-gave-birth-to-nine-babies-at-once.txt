A post that contains a video in which a woman can be seen with a huge belly sitting on a hospital bed is being shared on social media. The post claims that she gave birth to nine babies, which are shown in the video. Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.
Claim: Photo of a woman with a huge belly who gave birth to nine babies at a time.
Fact: The name of the woman from the viral post is Huang Guoxian. Her belly grew uncontrollably due to Ovarian cancer. She underwent surgery to get rid of the lumps and fluid that formed in her abdomen due to cancer. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
We searched the internet with relevant keywords and found a few news reports about the woman from the viral video. The Daily Mail reported in October 2020 that the woman’s name is Huang Guoxian, and her abdomen grew abnormally for two years due to terminal cancer. Doctors performed surgery on her to remove the tumour and fluid that formed in her belly due to ovarian cancer.
A few other news reports from the time before her condition was diagnosed can be read here, here and here . Clearly, it can be understood that the viral post has falsely used her pictures to claim that she gave birth to nine babies at a time, which is false.
To summarise, pictures of a woman diagnosed with ovarian cancer are shared with a false narrative that she gave birth to nine babies at once.
