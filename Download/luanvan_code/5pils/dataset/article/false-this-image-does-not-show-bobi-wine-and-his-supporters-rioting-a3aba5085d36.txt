An image posted together with a claim that the leader of the National Unity Platform party, Bobi Wine, and his supporters were involved in the destruction of a road is FALSE.
The claim, made in a tweet that includes an image of a riot scene with a fire burning in the middle of the road, says that National Unity Platform supporters and their leader, Bobi Wine, whose legal name is Robert Kyagulanyi, are responsible for destroying a road worth billions of taxpayers’ money.
In the tweet shared from the account of Kigganda Godfrey, the author wonders why the presidential candidate and his NUP supporters love trading in violence.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image was taken in April 2011 during the riots that broke out in Uganda following the arrest and mistreatment of then opposition leader Kizza Besigye for his participation in a “Walk-to-Work” protest over the high food prices and the cost of living.
The image of the riot was published in a blog by Willian Kituuka in April 2011 and is neither recent nor does it have any connection to the National Unity Platform or its leader Bobi Wine as claimed in the tweet.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweeted image alongside a claim that the National Unity Platform party leader Bobi Wine and his supporters were involved in the destruction of a road and finds it to be FALSE.
