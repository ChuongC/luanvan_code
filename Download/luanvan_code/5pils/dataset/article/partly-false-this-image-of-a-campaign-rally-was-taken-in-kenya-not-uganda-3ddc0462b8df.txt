A Facebook post with multiple images alongside a claim that the photos were taken during presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi’s campaign rallies in Uganda, is PARTLY FALSE.
The first photo in the post is an aerial image of a crowd in procession while the second and third photos show Mr Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine, atop a vehicle, addressing a crowd. The images are captioned in a local dialect that translates, “Bobi Wine is loved”.
However, a Google reverse image search of the first image of a convoy of vehicles surrounded by a crowd was taken in Nairobi, Kenya. The photo, which was first shared in 2017, shows supporters accompanying opposition leader Raila Odinga’s convoy, and was taken by Agence France-Presse’s (AFP) Yasuyoshi Chiba.
The image featured in the NewYork Times and the NewVision in the same year.
A Google reverse image search of the two images shows these are indeed from MP Kyagulanyi’s campaign trail in the West Nile region in Uganda. The images have been featured in an article on the Daily Express blog.
The National Unity Platform party presidential candidate returned to West Nile on December 7, 2020, which is where he started his campaigns.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with multiple images alongside the claim that they were taken during a campaign rally of Ugandan presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi and find it to be PARTLY FALSE.
