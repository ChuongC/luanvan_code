An image shared on Facebook claiming Egypt’s Cairo Tower has been decorated with the Palestinian flag is ALTERED.
At 187 metres, Cairo Tower is one of the tallest buildings in Africa.
The accompanying post reads, “Cairo Tower today is decorated with the flag of beloved Palestine. ”
The post comes at a time when Israel and Palestine, which have historically had intermittent clashes, are locked in a deadly conflict since early May 2021, leaving scores dead and others injured.
A ceasefire between the two countries came into effect on May 21, 2021, ending 11 days of fighting, with both sides claiming victory.
Nonetheless, reverse image search results reveal the picture has been doctored. The original photo was uploaded to Wikimedia Commons in 2010. The tower was decorated to light up with purple hues at night, and not the colours of the Palestinian flag.
Also, there are no news reports about the Cairo Tower building being lit up like a Palestinian flag on May 18, or any other date during the Israel and Hamas conflict in May 2021.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming Cairo Tower in Egypt has been decorated with the flag of Palestine and finds it to be ALTERED.
