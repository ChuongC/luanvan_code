An image shared on Facebook purporting to show Bomet Woman Representative Linet Chepkorir, also known as Toto, with Kevin Rigathi, Kenyan Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua’s son, is ALTERED.
The image, shared on 14 October 2022, purports to be of the two posing beside a plane branded Kenya Air Force. The accompanying text reads: “Rigathi Gachagua’s son with Linet Toto”.
The image has also been shared here and here, referring to the 13 October 2022 trip to the YouthConnekt Africa Summit in Kigali, Rwanda.
This was Gachagua’s first official foreign trip to Rwanda. Delegates, including Chepkorir, accompanied the Kenyan Vice President.
However, in the images shared on the day of the trip, Chepkorir is pictured alone beside the plane. A Google reverse image search of the photo we are fact-checking also brings up images of Chepkorir posing alone beside the Kenya Air Force plane.
While Gachagua’s son did attend the summit, in the images shared online, Kevin Rigathi is in a different attire from the one in the photo we are fact-checking.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook purporting to show Bomet Woman Representative Linet Chepkorir, a.k.a. Toto, with Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua’s son, Kevin Rigathi, and has found it to be ALTERED.
