Multiple photos of PM Modi, through a social media post are being shared widely online claiming that PM Modi changed his clothes four times while meeting four people in a single day. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Images of PM Modi in four different clothes in a single day.
Fact: The images in the post were taken on four different days and not on the same day. Modi met UP CM Yogi Adityanath on 11 June, Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla on 10 June, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma on 02 June and Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat on 07 June 2021. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
