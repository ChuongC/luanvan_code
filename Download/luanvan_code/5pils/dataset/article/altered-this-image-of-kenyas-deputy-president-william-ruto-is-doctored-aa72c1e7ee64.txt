A photo shared on Facebook claiming to show Deputy President William Ruto smoking a cigarette is ALTERED.
In the photo, the deputy president appears to be puffing on a lit cigarette held to his lips with his right hand. The text on the post says he has “sunk into depression and resulted into smoking and drinking alcohol”.
However, an online search reveals that the original photo, which was first seen online in December 2012, shows Mr Ruto in an animated pose and does not show him smoking a cigarette, or holding anything in his hands.
While the left hand appears to have been cropped out of the image, the thumb and forefinger of the right hand have been erased in the original image and replaced by editing in the cigarette and the hand holding it. This has left sections of the white shirt and dotted tie worn by DP Ruto in the photo looking disproportionate and smudged in the doctored image.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo claiming to show Deputy President William Ruto smoking a cigarette and finds it to be ALTERED.
