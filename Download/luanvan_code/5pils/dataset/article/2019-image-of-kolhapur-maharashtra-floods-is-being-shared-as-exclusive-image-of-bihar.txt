Photo of a road submerged in floodwater while several areas were inundated with flood water is being shared on social media claiming it as the pathetic situation in Bihar. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of a road submerged in floodwater in Bihar.
Fact: The photo is not related to the recent floods in Bihar. It was captured during the Kolhapur (Maharashtra) floods in 2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When we subjected the image to reverse image search technique, an article of ‘The Hindustan Times’ with the same image was obtained in the results. The image in the article had the description– ‘Flood situation in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur as on August 7, 2019’. 
The surroundings in the photo can also be seen in a video with the title ‘Flood of Panchaganga River Kolhapur 2019’. So the photo was taken during the Kolhapur (Maharashtra) floods in 2019. 
In August 2019, Kolhapur and Sangli districts of Maharashtra faced severe floods. Several areas of Kolhapur were inundated with floodwater after the Panchganga river had received huge amounts of water. Further information about the Kolhapur and Sangli floods can be read here.
To sum it up, 2019 image of Kolhapur (Maharashtra) floods is being shared as ‘Exclusive image of Bihar’.
