A post on Facebook claiming that a school bus heading to Bukhungu Stadium ahead of the Building Bridges Initiative Consultative Meeting held in Mumias on January 18 was set on fire is FALSE.
The post contains an image of a bus on fire, adding that ‘rowdy youths’ had stated that school buses ferrying people to the BBI meeting would not be allowed to use the Bungoma-Mumias-Kakamega road.”
The post adds that the school bus was set ablaze while en route to the Bukhungu Stadium in Mumias on January 18.
Mumias sub-county OCPD Peter Kattam confirmed that the incident in question did not take place. Speaking to PesaCheck on the phone, he stated that there were no reports of a vehicle being set ablaze in Mumias on the day in question.
Additionally, there were no media reports of the incident, which would have attracted some attention given the fact that it happened on the day of the BBI forum, and near where the event took place.
A reverse image search of the photo that was shared with the post shows it was taken in November 2015 after a bus caught fire when a chef threw a burning gas canister onto a street in China. The photograph is credited to the Chinese News Service, and was republished by a number of publications, including the South China Morning Post and the Daily Mail.
The original image shows a building behind the bus with text in Chinese language, part of which has been cropped out in the image shared on Facebook.
PesaCheck has looked into a post on Facebook claiming that a school bus heading to Bukhungu Stadium was set on fire and finds it to be FALSE.
