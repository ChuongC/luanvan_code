A tweet with an image claiming to show a huge voter turnout in Nyeri County, during the 9 August 2022 Kenyan general election is FALSE.
The tweet is accompanied by an image showing a huge number of people in a meandering queue around an open field.
The accompanying caption reads: “Nyeri is so decided. Rigathi Gachagua understood the assignment from Bill, honestly Baba’s final journey to Bondo is fully confirmed. FREEDOM IS COMING!!”
The image was also shared on another Facebook post, with the user claiming it shows a polling station in Homa Bay County.
However, a reverse image search on the photo we are debunking reveals it is neither from Nyeri nor Homa Bay as alleged in the two posts.
According to the search result, the photo is from South Africa and was taken during the first all-race election on 27 April 1994, in which the late Nelson Mandela won, becoming the first black president in the country.
AP News reported that the 1994 poll was the first mixed election in South Africa, and voters turned out in large numbers to vote and take charge of their country.
Additionally, we looked at the coverage of the elections by the local media which reported that turnout in Nyeri was somewhat low on the morning of the voting day, with a section of residents blaming the weather.
PesaCheck has examined a tweet with an image claiming to show a huge voter turnout in Nyeri County, during the 9 August 2022 Kenyan general election and finds it to be FALSE.
