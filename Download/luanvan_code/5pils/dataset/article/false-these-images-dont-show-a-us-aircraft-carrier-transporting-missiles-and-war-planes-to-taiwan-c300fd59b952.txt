This Facebook post with images claiming to show the United States (US) transporting missiles and warplanes to Taiwan in August 2022 are FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo text posted along with the photos translates as; “The US is taking a ship carrying missiles and warplanes to Taiwan. The fear that this action may strengthen the conflict between the US and China has become a tension for the world.”
On 4 August 2022, the White House announced that an aircraft carrier will stay in the vicinity of Taiwan “to monitor the situation” as China launches missiles in the region.
However, the photos used to advance the claim are false. Reverse image search results here, here, and here show that the photos in the claim are not related to the 4 August 2022 US announcement.
A caption accompanying the first image reads: “A Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) F-16V fighter jet lands on a highway used as an emergency runway during the Han Kuang military exercise simulating China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) invading the island of Changhua, Taiwan on 28 May 2019”. The image is credited to Reuters.
The second image shows “the US Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets multirole fighters and an EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft (2nd R) on board USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) aircraft carrier as it sails in the South China Sea on its way to Singapore on 16 October 2019.” The image is credited to CATHERINE LAI/AFP via Getty Images.
The last image shows “Chinese soldiers sitting atop tanks as they drive in a parade to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, at Tiananmen Square on 1 October 2019 in Beijing, China”. The image was credited to Kevin Frayer/Getty Images.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with images claiming to show a US aircraft carrier loaded with missiles and warplanes headed to Taiwan in August 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
