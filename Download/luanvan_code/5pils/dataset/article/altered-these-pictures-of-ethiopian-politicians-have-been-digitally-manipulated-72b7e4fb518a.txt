These pictures shared on Facebook purporting to show Ethiopian politicians Debretsion Gebremichael and Getachew Reda are ALTERED.
Debretsion is the Tigray regional president, and Getachew is his advisor and spokesperson of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front. The two politicians have, since November 2020, been leading Tigray forces, which are fighting the Ethiopian federal government troops.
The pictures are accompanied by an Amharic text that states: “Breaking news. Yesterday in Mekelle, there was a rumour that said an Ethiopian Special Commando Air Force had entered Eritrea for operation, causing great anxiety among the leaders of the TPLF. Following this, sources indicated that they intend to continue their previous disguising work.”
Other social media users shared here and here similar claims.
However, as seen here and here, Google lens and Google reverse image search results show that the images are doctored.
The first original image, which was altered and attached to the claim, was shared on the Alamy website on 8 April 2014. The caption reads: “Ethiopian priest, Yeha monastery, Tigray, Ethiopia.” Image credit is given to J Marshall.
The second original image was published on this website on 1 February 2020.
PesaCheck has examined images shared on Facebook purporting to show politician Debretsion Gebremichael and Getachew Reda and finds them to be ALTERED.
