A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Brazilian football legend, Edson Arantes do Nascimento, widely known by his nickname Pele, mourning at soccer star Diego Maradona’s grave is ALTERED.
The image has gone viral on social media with emotional captions, such as one that reads, “Pele bids farewell to Maradona”, while another says, “Million dollar picture”.
The claim has been shared here, here, here and here.
However, a reverse image search revealed that the viral picture is photoshopped. PesaCheck found the original photo on Getty Images, a visual media company that supplies stock photos. Over the years, several websites related to funeral services have used the same picture.
On November 25, after news of Maradona’s death broke, Pele took to his verified Twitter handle to pay tribute to the Argentine icon. He shared a picture of Maradona celebrating Argentina’s World Cup victory in 1986.
The 60-year-old football star died of cardiac arrest and was laid to rest at a cemetery outside Buenos Aires in Argentina on November 26. While thousands flooded the streets of Buenos Aires as the footballer’s coffin made its way for burial, Maradona’s funeral was a private ceremony attended only by family and close friends.
PesaCheck looked into the Facebook post with an image claiming to show Brazilian football legend Pele, mourning at the gravestone of soccer star Diego Maradona and finds it has been ALTERED.
