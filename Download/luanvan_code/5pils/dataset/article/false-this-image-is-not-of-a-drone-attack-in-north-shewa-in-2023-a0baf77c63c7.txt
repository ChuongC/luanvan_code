This Facebook post with an image purportedly of a drone attack in North Shewa in 2023 is FALSE.
The Amharic text accompanying the image translates to; “Reports are coming out that Abiy Ahmed carried out a drone attack on farmers in a place called Rasa in North Shewa.”
A statement attached to the photo reads: “Breaking news. Drone strikes on Amhara region”.
However, Google’s reverse image search results showed that the picture under investigation is not of a drone attack in North Shewa in 2023 as claimed.
The photo was shared on the Getty Images website with the caption, “The first Turkish military drone lands at Gecitkale Airport, on December 16, 2019. Bayraktar TB2 armed unmanned aerial vehicles, stationed at Naval Air Base Command in Turkey’s Aegean district of Dalaman, landed in TRNC at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) following a green light from the government of the country.”
