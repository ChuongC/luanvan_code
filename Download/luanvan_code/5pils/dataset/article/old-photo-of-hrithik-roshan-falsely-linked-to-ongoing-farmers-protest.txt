A photo of Hrithik Roshan is being shared on social media with a claim that it shows him coming  in support of the protesting farmers. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Hrithik Roshan supporting the recent farmers’ protest.
Fact: It is an old photo from 2018 when Hrithik Roshan participated in Guru Gobind Singh Jayanthi celebrations in Mumbai. It is not related to ongoing farmers’ protest. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When we searched about the photo on the internet, many similar photos were found to be posted by several users in January 2018. A YouTube channel (‘Bollywood Spy Hindi’) had published a video related to the photo on 06 January 2018 with the title – ‘Guru Gobind Singh की जयंती पर Hrithik Roshan पहुचे अपने पिता संग’ (Hrithik Roshan participated in Guru Gobind Singh Jayanthi celebrations along with his father). The same people from the photo shared in the post can be seen in the video. Many other old posts with the same photo can be seen here and here.
Also, the ‘Filmfare.com’ has published many photos from the event in 2018. We did not find any recent posts by Hrithik Roshan on his social media handles regarding the ongoing farmers’ protest.
To sum it up, 2018 photo of Hrithik Roshan participation in Guru Gobind Singh Jayanthi celebrations in Mumbai is falsely shared as that related to ongoing farmers’ protest.
