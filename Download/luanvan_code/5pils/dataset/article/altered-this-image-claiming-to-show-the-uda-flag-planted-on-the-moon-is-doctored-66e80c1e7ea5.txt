An image shared on Facebook claiming to show the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party flag planted on the moon is ALTERED.
The image shows an astronaut on the face of the moon holding the unfurled flag printed on the yellow colours and logo of the political party.
“UDA Flag is the first flag since creation to be erected on the Moon,” reads the post which also invites users to follow a Facebook page named Kenya Kwanza TV. The Facebook transparency information of the page reveals that it has changed its name at least five times.
A reverse image search reveals that the picture does not contain a UDA flag as claimed.
Among the search results include an article by NPR about the moon landing in 1969. The caption indicates; “From NASA: Apollo 12 commander Charles “Pete” Conrad unfurls the United States flag on the lunar surface during the first extravehicular activity on Nov. 19, 1969.”
NPR credits the image to the US’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
PesaCheck has examined the image of a Facebook post claiming to show the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party flag planted on the moon, and finds it to be ALTERED.
