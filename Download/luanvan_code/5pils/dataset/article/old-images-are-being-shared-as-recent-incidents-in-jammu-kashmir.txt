A post with several disturbing images is being shared widely on Facebook claiming that they belong to recent events in Kashmir. Let’s try to check the authenticity of the images posted. 
Claim: Photos of the present situation in Kashmir.    
Fact: The photos are old ones relating to various incidents. And, one photo is not that of India. They resurfaced on social media after the amendment of Article 370 in Kashmir. Hence, the claim that the photos posted depict the present situation in Kashmir is MISLEADING.
When the photos in the post are subjected to reverse image search technique, they are found to be old photos.
