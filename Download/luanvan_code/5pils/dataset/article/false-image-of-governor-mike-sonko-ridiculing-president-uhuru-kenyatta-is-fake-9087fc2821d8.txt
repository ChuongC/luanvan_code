A screenshot with the name and image of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and which dismisses President Uhuru Kenyatta and other leaders in a derogatory language is FALSE.
The screenshot, posted online by Facebook user ‘Hon GK Malema’, is made to appear as if it was originally posted from an account called ‘Mike Mbuvi Sonko’. In the caption, user ‘Hon GK Malema’ refers to the governor as “his mentor and a no nonsense politician”.
However, Governor Sonko has distanced himself from the post and the Facebook account it purportedly came from. Speaking to PesaCheck on the phone, the governor says he did not publish the post nor does he own the Facebook account in question.
“All my official communications are published on my official Facebook page under the name Mike Sonko,” he says.
Searching the account ‘Mike Mbuvi Sonko’ for the contents shown in the screenshot yielded no results.
Governor Sonko’s official Facebook page is verified and has over two million followers. The page was set up on September 21, 2010.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a screenshot claiming to show Governor Mike Sonko insulting President Uhuru Kenyatta and other leaders, and finds it to be FALSE.
