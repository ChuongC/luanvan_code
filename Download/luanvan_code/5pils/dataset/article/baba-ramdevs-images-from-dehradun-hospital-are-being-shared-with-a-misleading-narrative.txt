Many Facebook users are sharing a post with a photo of Baba Ram Dev alleging that he got operated in a foreign hospital. Let’s try to analyze the claims made in the post.
Claim:  Ramdev Baba got operated in a hospital in Germany.
Fact:  The photo in the post is the one taken when Ramdev Baba broke his 9-day long fast at a Dehradun hospital in 2011. So, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING    
When the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image search, it was found in an article of ‘First post’ published on June 13, 2011. Baba Ramdev had been on a hunger strike since 4th June 2011 demanding the then government for a tougher anti-corruption law and for the return of black money stashed away abroad. On 13th June, though he didn’t get any assurance from the Centre on his demands, he broke his fast in the presence of spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.
To sum it up, Baba Ramdev’s images from Dehradun hospital are being shared with a misleading narrative.
