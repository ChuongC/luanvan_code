An image post of a drone that a Facebook user claims was used in destroying the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) force at Wollo front is FALSE.
The post text in Amharic reads, “Our drones making history on the Wollo Front !!”
Wollo is a province in the northern Amhara region of Ethiopia.
It was reported that Dessie and Kombolcha, major cities in the south Wollo Zone of the Amhara bordering the Tigray region, were captured by the TPLF forces.
The Ethiopian national army has reportedly launched air and ground offensives to drive out the TPLF from the Amhara region and the claim is made under this context.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture has been online before the Ethiopian conflict.
PesaCheck investigations show the picture shows an armed United State Air force drones and was published on 16 April 2014.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show that is employed in destroying the TPLF force at Wollo front t and finds it to be FALSE.
