A Facebook post claiming to show a photo of opposition Forum for Democratic Change president Patrick Amuriat donning a Uganda Prisons Service uniform is FALSE.
The photo is a montage of a uniformed officer and Amuriat. The caption in Luganda claims that Amuriat is a Uganda Prisons Services officer.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the officer is Samuel Akena, the new Assistant Commissioner General of Uganda Prisons Service.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show a photo of Forum for Democratic Change president Patrick Amuriat in Uganda Prisons uniform and finds it to be FALSE.
