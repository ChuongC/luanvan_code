An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Algeria’s national football team goalkeeper Rais M’Bolhi in a training session ahead of the 2019 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) match with Kenya’s Harambee Stars is FALSE.
The post, which has over 3,000 reactions at the time of publishing this article, is actually of former Ivory Coast goalkeeper Boubacar Barry, who was stretching on the crossbar of a goal post during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil in 2014.

A reverse image search shows that it was taken by AFP photographer Issouf Sanogo and shared on Getty Images.
The post claiming to show M’Bolhi was first shared ahead of the match between Kenya and Algeria on 23 June. Kenya is in Group C of the tournament, alongside Algeria, Senegal and Tanzania.
The Harambee Stars lost the match against Algeria 2–0.
PesaCheck has looked into the photo purported to be of the Algerian national football team goalkeeper in a training session ahead of their match with Kenya that was played on June 23 in Egypt and finds it to be FALSE.
