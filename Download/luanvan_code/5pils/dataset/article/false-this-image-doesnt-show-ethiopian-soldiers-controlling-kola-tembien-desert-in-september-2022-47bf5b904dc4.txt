A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) soldiers in control of Kola Tembien desert in the Tigray region, Ethiopia, is FALSE.
The Amharic text accompanying the image translates as; “Breaking News: Kola Tembien, where the leaders of the terrorist TPLF train and hide, has been completely captured by our Ethiopian National Defense Force, and the enemy is scattered.”
Kola Tembien is a woreda in Tigray region.
The war between the Ethiopian federal government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) resumed full scale on 24 August 2022. News reports indicate Ethiopian and Eritrean government forces have launched an attack targeting rebel forces in the northern region of Tigray.
However, Google reverse image search results show the photo is of ENDF soldiers at Gashena town in the Amhara region, Ethiopia.
The image is of soldiers in a truck in Gashena town on 6 December 2021.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show Ethiopian National Defence Force soldiers, who have taken control of the Kola Tembien desert in the country’s Tigray region, and finds it to be FALSE.
