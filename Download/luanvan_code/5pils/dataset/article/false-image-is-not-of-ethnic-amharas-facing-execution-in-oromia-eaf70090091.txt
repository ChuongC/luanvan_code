This tweet with an image of alleged Ethiopian ethnic Amharas lined up for execution in the Oromia region is FALSE.
The post reads: “Time is Ticking & genocide is happening in #Ethiopia. Help End #AmharaGenocide the extermination of the #Amhara people by @PMEthiopia govt backed Oromo Terrorist groups. #AmharaGenocideInOromia. ‘For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.”
International organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Clooney Foundation for Justice, as well as Pope Francis are tagged on the tweet.
“Amhara genocide in Oromia region of Ethiopia” is written on the picture.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the image is unrelated to Ethiopia.
The picture was shared on this website on 18 August 2020. It is of two soldiers publicly executed in Somalia for raping a 10-year-old boy. The image description is: “Army soldiers killed the two alleged rapists in Baidoa August 18, 2020.”
As seen here and here, the same image was shared on other websites in 2020.
There is an ongoing war in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. Protests erupted in December 2022 in various cities of the Oromia region after Fano, an informal armed group from the Amhara region, reportedly killed civilians and displaced others. Previous media reports implied that the Amharas were killed and displaced.
PesaCheck has examined the tweet with an image allegedly of Amharas executed in the Oromia region and found it to be FALSE.
