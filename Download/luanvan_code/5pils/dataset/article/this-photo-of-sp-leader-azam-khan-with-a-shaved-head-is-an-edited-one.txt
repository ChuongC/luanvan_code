Claim: Photo of SP leader Azam Khan with a shaved head. He shaved his head in memory of Mulayam Singh Yadav.Fact: The posted photo is an edited one. In the original photo, Azam Khan is not seen with a shaved head. Also, the photo was taken in June 2022 whereas Mulayam Singh Yadav passed away in October 2022. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When we searched with keywords on the internet, many news articles with an uncropped version of the photo were found in the search results. The original version of the photo can be found in the ‘Hindustan Times’ article with the title – “‘Get well soon’: Akhilesh Yadav meets ailing Azam Khan in Delhi hospital”. In the original photo, there is hair on Azam Khan’s head. Also, the photo was taken in June 2022 whereas Mulayam Singh Yadav passed away in October 2022.
Various news agencies picked up the photo from Akhilesh Yadav’s tweet. Another photo of Azam Khan from a different angle can be seen in his tweet.
