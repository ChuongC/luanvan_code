An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed meeting Eleni Gabre-Madhin in Brussels Belgium is FALSE.
“Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Dr. Eleni Gebre Medhin meeting in Brussels Belgium,” the Amharic text accompanying the image translates.
Eleni Gabre-Madhin is the Chief Innovation Officer within UN Development Programmes’ regional bureau for Africa, a post she has held since September 2021.
In November 2021, the Ethiopian government removed Eleni from being a member of the Independent Economic Council that was formed to support the Ethiopian Prime Minister’s economic reform agenda. Around the same time, the University of Gondar, which had awarded Eleni an Honorary Degree of Humane Letters in 2013, announced its revocation. Both events were linked to her participation in an “unpatriotic” meeting.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture used in the claim has been used online in different contexts and does not show Abiy with Eleni.
The image was published on Abiy’s official Facebook account on 17 February 2022. Its description reads, “PM Abiy Ahmed meeting Kristalina Georgieva, director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Brussels Belgium.”
The prime minister arrived in Brussels to participate in the 6th European Union-African Union (EU-AU) Summit.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed meeting Eleni Gabre-Madhin in Brussels, Belgium, and finds it to be FALSE.
