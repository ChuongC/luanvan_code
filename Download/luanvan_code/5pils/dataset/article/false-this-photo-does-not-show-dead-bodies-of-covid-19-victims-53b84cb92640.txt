A Facebook post claiming to show bodies of people who have died of COVID-19 lined up on the ground is FALSE.
The image shows a woman carrying one of the supposed bodies, sealed in black bags, with one hand. The post does not say where the photo was taken.
However, a Google reverse image search shows the photo was first published by European Pressphoto Agency on May 27, 2020 and is credited to photographer Crist√≥bal Herrera. It was taken at Torch of Friendship Park, Miami during a protest held to honour the lives lost in the novel coronavirus pandemic and to hold Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and US President Donald Trump accountable for their handling of the health crisis. The same photo was used in a Spanish article a day later.
Similar mock funeral protests have been witnessed in Georgia and Washington DC.
COVID-19 has so far infected over 7 million people and killed over 400,000 globally. Over 2 million of the total confirmed cases are from the United States, which has also recorded the highest number of deaths so far.
PesaCheck has looked into the photo claiming to show bodies of people who have died of COVID-19 lined up on the ground and finds it to be FALSE.
