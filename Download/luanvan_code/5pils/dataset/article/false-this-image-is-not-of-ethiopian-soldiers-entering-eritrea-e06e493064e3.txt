This Facebook post with an image supposedly of Ethiopian soldiers who entered Eritrea after betraying their government and is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by a statement partly translated as; “The Ethiopian army betrayed the Ethiopian government and entered Eritrea. It’s been two weeks since Abiy Ahmed started a war against the Amhara people and he faced a severe challenge from the country’s army.”
The post further claims that PM Abiy ordered the worst massacre of the Amhara people, but the military refused to obey the order arguing that the Amhara people were by their side, treating their wounds, providing them with food and drink, and showing them their love for the country.
“Also, his attempt to arrest several members of the army were unsuccessful. Yesterday 650 soldiers entered Eritrea with all their weapons,” the post added.
The conflict in the Amhara region was prompted by the federal government’s decision to disarm all regional special forces and incorporate them into a centralised army.
We performed a Google reverse image search and the results were that the image under investigation is old and, therefore, unrelated to the claim.
The picture was shared on this website on 30 October 2021 with the caption, “Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) soldiers train in the field of Dabat.” Image credit is given to AFP.
Dabat is in the Amhara region.
PesaCheck has examined a Facebook post with an image supposedly of members of the Ethiopian army who entered Eritrea after betraying their government and found it to be FALSE.
