A Facebook photo showing Chinese actor Jackie Chan wearing a T-shirt branded with a picture of Ugandan First Son General Muhoozi Kainerugaba is ALTERED.
The post, also shared on Twitter, purports to show the martial art actor and American artiste Jaden Smith posing for a photo. Jackie Chan’s T-shirt with the image of Kainerugaba has the inscription: “The Next President”.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image was altered to include the face of Kainerugaba and the text: “The Next President”.
The original image was taken during the “Kick It With the Karate Kid” Street Festival on 27 May 2010 in Dallas, Texas. In the photo, Jackie Chan’s T-shirt does not have the image of Kainerugaba.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a photo of Chinese actor Jackie Chan wearing a T-shirt branded with the face of Uganda’s Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba and finds it to have been ALTERED.
