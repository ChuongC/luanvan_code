A tweet with images claiming to show explosions in Masaka in Uganda is FALSE.
The tweet has two images showing explosions with the word Masaka, posted above them and an emoticon of a broken heart, suggesting that photos show events in Masaka, a Ugandan town.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the images in the tweet were taken in Jakarta, Indonesia and not Masaka, Uganda. The images show Mount Semeru, the highest volcano on Indonesia’s most densely populated island of Java, spewing hot clouds of ash.
According to multiple media reports, the incident happened on January 16, 2021 and the photos were released by Indonesia’s National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB). The images were featured in The Mainichi, Yahoo News, News4Jax and Click Orlando.
