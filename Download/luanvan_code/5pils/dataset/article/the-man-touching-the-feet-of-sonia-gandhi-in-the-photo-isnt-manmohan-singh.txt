Many Facebook users are sharing a post with the picture of Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh alleging that the latter is touching the feet of the former. Let’s try to analyze the claims made in the post.
Claim: Manmohan Singh had touched the feet of Sonia Gandhi.
Fact: The man with the orange turban in the photo is a Congress representative, not Manmohan Singh as alleged in the post. Hence, the claim is FALSE.
When the picture in the post was run through Google Reverse Image search, it was found in the Getty images library. The description seen below the photo is “a representative touches the feet of Sonia Gandhi as Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi looks on during the Indian Youth Congress’s national level convention of Elected Office Bearers in New Delhi”. So, it is clear from it that the man with the orange turban in the photo isn’t Manmohan Singh, he is a Congress representative.
This event took place in 2011 and it was attended by Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi. In it, Manmohan Singh can be seen wearing a blue turban.
To sum it up, the man with the orange turban seen touching the feet of Sonia Gandhi isn’t Manmohan Singh.
