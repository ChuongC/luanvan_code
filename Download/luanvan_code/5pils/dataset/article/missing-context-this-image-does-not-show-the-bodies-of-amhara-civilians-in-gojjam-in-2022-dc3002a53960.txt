This tweet with an image claiming to show the bodies of Amhara civilians in Gojjam in 2022 is MISSING CONTEXT.
“Dead bodies of Amhara civilians in Gojjam. These victims were killed by the government forces,” the post reads.
The post is accompanied by an image that shows people lying on the ground and a man hanging on a stick.
In May 2022, the government of Ethiopia launched a crackdown on armed militias in the Amhara region, leading to the arrest of more than 4,000 people. Also, a clash around the same time in the East Gojjam Zone of the Amhara region between the government forces and Fano, an informal armed group in the Amhara region, resulted in the death of two people.
However, a reverse image search using Google reveals that the picture attached to the post is old and has no relation to the conflict in the Amhara region.
The picture was shared on this website on 4 June 2019 to support an article with the title, “Ethnic Based Massacre & Genocide Of Ethiopia (2003–2018).”
The caption of the photo says, “Bloody Mawura, (ማዉራ) Layarmacho November 3–9, 2015.”
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image claiming to show the bodies of Amhara civilians in Gojjam in 2022 and finds it to be MISSING CONTEXT.
