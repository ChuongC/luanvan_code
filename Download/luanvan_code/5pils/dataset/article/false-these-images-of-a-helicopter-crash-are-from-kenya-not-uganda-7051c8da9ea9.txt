A Facebook post with a claim that an aeroplane has been involved in an accident in Mukono District of Uganda is FALSE.
The post, which has two images of an incident involving a helicopter, shares a claim in Luganda — a local dialect in Uganda — stating that residents of Mukono stoned the aeroplane until it crashed to the ground.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the pictures are of an aviation accident that happened in Kenya on October 17, 2020, and not in Mukono as claimed in the post.
Governor Samuel Ole Tunai, along with three passengers, survived the helicopter crash that occurred in Melili in his Narok County.
The story has been wildly published by Kenyan media, including Kenyans.co.ke, KTN News Kenya, Nation News and Daily Nation.
No one was hurt in the incident that occurred as the crash survivors left Enkipejus village in Narok North sub-county, where they had attended the burial of Mzee Tompo ole Sasai, father of a county employee, Julius Sasai.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a claim that an aircraft has been involved in an accident in Mukono District in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
