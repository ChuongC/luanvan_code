A tweet accompanied by an image purporting to show Presidential Escort motorbike riders at Rigathi Gachagua’s home in Mathira constituency is FALSE.
The tweet, which is dated 15 August 2022 reads: “Mathira constituency. Gachagua’s home. Ni noma msee (it’s serious man).”
The tweet was shared online on 15 August 2022, hours before the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) announced the presidential results of Kenya’s 9 August general elections.
A similar claim as the one we are debunking appears here.
Gachagua, the Kenya Kwanza Coalition presidential running mate, is the outgoing Mathira member of parliament.
The Presidential Escort Unit is mandated to provide security to specific prominent figures such as the president, deputy president and their families.
However, a Google reverse search of the image shows that it has been online since 2017. The Standard Group used the photo in this news report, with the caption indicating it was taken in 2017 at the Bomas of Kenya.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet accompanied by an image purporting to show Presidential Escort riders at Rigathi Gachagua’s home in Mathira constituency and found it to be FALSE.
