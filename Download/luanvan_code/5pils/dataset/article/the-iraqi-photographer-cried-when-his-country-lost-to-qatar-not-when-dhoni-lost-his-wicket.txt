A post is being shared on Facebook with a claim that a photographer cried after Dhoni was out during the 2019 World Cup semifinal between India & New Zealand.  Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: The photographer in the picture cried after M.S. Dhoni’s wicket.
Fact: The photographer in the picture is an Iraqi photographer, who cried after his country’s exit from the AFC Asian Cup – 2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.  
When the picture of the photographer is cropped from the posted photo and is run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the photo was found to be posted back in January-2019 by multiple internet users and websites. The same photo was tweeted by a TV correspondent with a description that the man in the picture is Mohammed AL Azzawi, who was in tears after his country (Iraq) lost to Qatar in AFC Asian Cup-2019, related to Soccer. Also, another picture of the photographer can be found in the tweet.

To sum it up, the Iraqi photographer cried when his country lost to Qatar, not when Dhoni lost his wicket.
