An image of a damaged road is being widely shared on social media claiming that it shows the horrible condition of Indian roads. The post satirically adds that it is built with a new technology in collaboration with Israel. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of a damaged road in India.
Fact: The road shown in the image belongs to Thailand. Several social media users in Thailand shared this picture in 2019 criticising the poor quality of roads. Thai PBS also published news article regarding the issue. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
On reverse image search of the viral image, we found that Thai Public Broadcasting Service website published a news article on 01 September 2019 with this image as the thumbnail. According to this article, social media users criticised the Ban Huai Thom-Na Nong Daeng Road, Pa Ko Subdistrict, Chanuman District, Amnat Charoen Province, which slipped out like a sheet after flooding caused by heavy rainfall.
We found that several Thailand social media users had shared this image on their timeline in 2019. One can see them here and here
To sum it up, old image of a damaged road in Thailand is being attributed to Indian roads
