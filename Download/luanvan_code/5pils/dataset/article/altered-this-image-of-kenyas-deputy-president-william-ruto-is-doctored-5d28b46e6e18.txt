A photo shared on Facebook claiming to show Deputy President William Ruto holding a panga (machete) is ALTERED.
In the photo, the deputy president appears to be holding a panga in his right hand. The text on the post says, “Ruto has been staging attacks to attract sympathy.”
However, a Google reverse image search and an online search reveals that the original photo, which was first seen online in October 2020, shows Mr Ruto addressing a crowd with no panga in his right hand. The only item he is holding is a microphone in his left hand.
The image was captured when Deputy President William Ruto addressed residents of Githurai in Kiambu County, on his way to Nairobi after attending a church service in Murang’a on October 5.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared on Facebook claiming to show Deputy President William Ruto holding a panga and finds it to be ALTERED.
