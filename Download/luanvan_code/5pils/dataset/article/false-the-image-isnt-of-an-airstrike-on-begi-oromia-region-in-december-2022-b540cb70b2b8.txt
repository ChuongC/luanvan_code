This Facebook post with an image apparently of the Ethiopian federal troops airstrike on Begi, Wollega, in the Oromia region of Ethiopia in December 2022 is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo text accompanying the image translates to; “Fascist Abiy Ahmed is currently carrying out airstrikes on Begi Wollega. SBO reports that the predatory Abiy Ahmed’s group, which has recently deployed the Amhara invading forces on the ground, is attacking Begi with MiG-29 today.”
Begi is a district in Oromia, which is part of the West Wollega Zone.
There are reports that dozens of civilians were killed in an airstrike by the federal government forces in West Wollega town in November 2022.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the photo is unrelated to the Ethiopian conflict.
The image was published on this website in November 2015.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image apparently of the Ethiopian federal government troops conducting an airstrike on Begi in Wollega, Oromia region of Ethiopia in December 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
