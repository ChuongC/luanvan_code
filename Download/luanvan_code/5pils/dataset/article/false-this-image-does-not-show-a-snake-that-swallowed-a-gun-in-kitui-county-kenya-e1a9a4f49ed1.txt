An image shared on Facebook claiming to show a snake that swallowed a gun in Kitui county in Kenya is FALSE.
The image shows a black snake-like form on the ground with the outline of what looks like a gun in the middle of its length around its stomach.
“Breaking. Female police officer from Kitui in a rude shock after a snake swallowed her gun after she went for a short call,” reads the post accompanying the image.
The post does not provide further information as to when the purported incident took place and what happened to the snake thereafter.
The image has been shared by other social media users including here and here.
A reverse image search brings up a number of articles and sites containing the picture, revealing that the photo was not taken in Kenya and does not show a real snake.
One of the sites is Artsy.net, which contains a collection of contemporary art pieces called 11.12 Gallery. The art gallery is located in the centre of Moscow’s Winzavod art district and is dedicated to the promotion of Russian art.
The description for this artwork indicates that it belongs to Vasily Slonov, and the piece itself is called AK-Python.
Slonov shared the art piece on his Instagram account on 21 August 2019.
PesaCheck has examined the image claiming to show a snake that swallowed a gun in Kitui county in Kenya and finds it to be FALSE.
