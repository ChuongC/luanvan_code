A tweet with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attack on the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) military base in Mekelle is FALSE.
The Amharic post shared on 17 August 2022 translates as; “Breaking Information Air Forces. The Ethiopian Air Force launched an attack on the military facilities used by the TPLF in Mekelle, the capital of the Tigray region.”
Mekelle is the capital city of the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia.
TPLF and Ethiopian federal forces have been engaged in an armed conflict since November 2020.
On 13 September 2022, Al Jazeera reported that 10 people were killed in air raids in Mekelle.
However, Yandex reverse image search results indicate that the photo in the claim is not related to the Ethiopian conflict.
The Aviation reports published the photo in an article headlined: “Why China Loves Russia’s Fighter Jets (As In Stealing All Of Their Technology)” on 16 April 2019.
The picture was also published on this website on 19 November 2019, in an article titled: “Ukraine is developing the Bliskavka supersonic missile. Anti-aircraft defense is said to be insufficient for it.”
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image claiming to show an Ethiopian Air Force attack on the TPLF military base in Mekelle and finds it to be FALSE.
