This Facebook post with an image claiming to show an airstrike that destroyed weapons belonging to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) at Shire town is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by an Amharic text that translates as; “Information: Today, In Shire city, a large cache of TPLF weapons is reduced to ashes by our heroic Air Force. also, a senior leader of TPLF was killed.”
Shire, also known as Inda Selassie, is a city and separate district in the Ethiopian Tigray region.
However, Google reverse image search results indicate the image is unrelated to an airstrike in Shire town.
The image was published on the Wikimedia Commons website with a caption indicating that it was a Russian Air Force’s Antonov An-26 aircraft. The photo was captured by photographer Igor Dvurekov at Levashovo, Russia, in July 2009.
The image was also published on this website on 13 October 2020, in an article titled, “Russian ‘mini freighter’ Ilyushin II-112V will hit the market in 2023.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show an airstrike that destroyed weapons belonging to the TPLF at Shire town and finds it to be FALSE.
