An image shared on Facebook claiming to show a drone attack between Alamata and Kobo towns of Ethiopia is FALSE.
“It is known that the Junta was fighting at Alamata on Tuesday, 1 February 2022, evening at 2:15 PM. However, she destroyed the Junta that was trying to transport a fleet full of five trucks, from Alamata to Kobo,” the post in Amharic reads.
From the context, it is understood that reference is made to the image of a drone in the post. And Junta is used in reference to the Tigray Forces.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the claimed image has no relation to the war in northern Ethiopia.
The Chicago Tribune website on 10 January 2020 shared the image. And the description of the image reads, “A U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone is pictured during a local training mission.” The same photo was published on other websites, as seen here, here, and here.
There are reports as seen here and here of fighting in Alamata. However, no mention is made of the use of drones and the images in the post are not related to attacks in Alamata or anywhere in Ethiopia.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show a drone attack on the way from Alamata to Kobo, Ethiopia and found it to be FALSE.
