A photo through a post is being widely shared on social media claiming that a child from the Jat community had been shot in the chest in 2016. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of a child from Jat community shot in the chest in 2016.
Fact: The photo is from the screenshot of a film named, ‘Mamlakat al-Naml’ (Kingdom of Ants) which was released in 2012. The movie was directed by Tunisian Chawki Mejri, based on the ‘Palestinian cause.’ Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When reverse image search is done on the photo, the photo of the same child was found in the screenshot of a YouTube video. The YouTube video uploaded on 10 April 2016 is a film named, ‘Kingdom of the Ants’, which is a movie directed by Chawki Mejri, based on the ‘Palestinian cause.’
‘Mamlakat al-Naml’ (Kingdom of Ants) is a film that was released in 2012. According to an article, “Mamlakat al-Naml is about a family struggling to survive on land being carved up piece by piece and a dream that is crushed night after night.”
In 2016, the Jat community in Haryana had protested about reservations in Jobs and colleges under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) quota. The agitation then had turned violent, and many people were killed. However, this photo of a kid being shot in the chest is not from that agitation.
To sum it up, a photo from a film is being falsely shared as a child from the Jat community shot in the chest in 2016.
