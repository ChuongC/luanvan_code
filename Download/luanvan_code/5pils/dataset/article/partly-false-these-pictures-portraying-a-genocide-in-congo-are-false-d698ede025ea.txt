A tweet with photos of women carrying babies and another of dead bodies in a mass grave with a claim that these show genocide in Congo is PARTLY FALSE.
The post, which was shared on October 14, is captioned, “There is a genocide in Congo but there (sic) world is silent about it”.
While it’s true there has been violence in the country, leaving more than 1,300 people dead in the first half of 2020, scores more in September, and thousands affected by crimes against humanity, the photos shared on this post do not capture the present state in Congo.
Reverse image search results of the photo of victims buried in a mass grave show that it was from the Rwanda genocide and was first published online in 2014. The image has been shared severally by multiple sites, including Reuters, and is credited to Corrine Dufka.
The picture of a woman on her knees with a baby on her back was shared in October 2014. The photo by Ulli Michel of Reuters, also captures the genocide in Rwanda. The picture was captured on the road connecting the Kibumba and Goma refugee camps.
Only one photo is from DRC, but it dates back to 2012, when it appeared together with an article reporting on women exposed to violence, especially in the refugee camps in the east of the country.
PesaCheck has investigated a tweet with photos of women with babies and another of dead bodies in a mass grave with a claim they show a genocide in Congo, and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
