A photo on Facebook and Twitter said to be of a protester fighting a police officer during the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya mass action in Nairobi on 20 March 2023 is FALSE.
The photo is of a man taking down an officer using the “spear move” (hitting your opponent in the stomach area using your head) common in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).
“Live scenes huku (here in) Nairobi CBD,” reads the text accompanying the photo.
Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya leaders and a section of their supporters on 20 March 2023 demonstrated in Nairobi against President William Ruto’s government and the high cost of living, among other issues.
But is the photo from the Azimio protests in Nairobi on 20 March 2023?
PesaCheck performed Google and Bing reverse image searches and established that the picture was taken in Chile.
The photo was published on 30 December 2019 during protests in the South American country.
We did a Google translation of the headline and the lead which helped us to establish that the incident happened in the Valparaiso area.
The incident was also captured in this video on Facebook on 30 December 2019.
PesaCheck has examined a photo shared on Facebook and Twitter purporting to be of a protester fighting a police officer during the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya mass action in Nairobi on 20 March 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
