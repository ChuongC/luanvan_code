A Facebook post claiming to show Mathira legislator Rigathi Gachagua and his counterpart David Gikaria, who represents Nakuru Town East, exchanging blows is FALSE.
The Facebook post claims the two Kenyan legislators exchanged blows after getting drunk at the Aberdares on 4 September 2021.
“Rigathi Gachagua and Nakuru town East MP exchanged blows after taking one too many in Aberdares yesterday,” reads the post shared on 5 September 2021.
It adds that the MPs fought after Gikaria told Gachagua that he could not deputise Deputy President William Ruto.
However, a reverse search shows the image was taken in 2015 when Nakuru Members of County Assembly (MCAs) had a scuffle in the House.
One of the articles published regarding that scuffle reports that the fight began when MCAs noticed a stranger at the Nakuru County Assembly press gallery. Those opposed to the then speaker, Susan Kihika’s leadership, believed the stranger had been sent to take their photos so she could punish them. They demanded the stranger leave, but another group insisted the man should stay.
Those against Kihika ejected the man, resulting in a scuffle with members in support of Kihika. However, after some time, things cooled down and Kihika proceeded with the day’s business. Kihika was at the time facing impeachment charges.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show Mathira Member of Parliament, Rigathi Gachagua exchanging blows with Nakuru Town East MP, David Gikaria, and finds it to be FALSE.
