A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Ethiopian commandos, who have taken control of Kobo city, is FALSE.
Published in Afaan Oromoo, the post translates as; “Those who say TPLF is in control of Kobo, look at how our commandos are having fun in Kobo. Kobo city is full of commandos. Victory for the defence”
Kobo is in northern Ethiopia, within the Semien Wollo Zone of the Amhara region.
On 29 August 2022, Voice of America reported that the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces had advanced southwards and were in control of Kobo. TPLF and Ethiopian federal forces have been fighting since November 2020. However, there had been a five-month lull before the fighting resumed on 24 August 2022.
According to Yandex reverse image search results, the picture advancing the claim has been used online in different contexts unrelated to the Ethiopian conflict.
The image was published on the Independent Turkey website on 12 November 2020, with a description that reads; “Ethiopia: Flames that burn hope.”
A website also published the photo on 26 November 2020 in an article headlined; “Commanders changed sides in operation in Ethiopia.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show Ethiopian commandos who have taken control of the city of Kobo and finds it to be FALSE.
