A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Kenyan former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka and Deputy President (DP) William Ruto at an iftar dinner on 20 April 2022 is FALSE.
The image shows four men sharing a light moment including Musyoka (second left), the DP (second right), and former Governor of Nairobi county Mike Sonko (right).
The post accompanying the image suggests that the meeting took place on 20 April 2022.
“Kalonzo meets the next President of Kenya Dr William Samoei Ruto Karen residence now,” reads the post.
On 12 March 2022, Musyoka, the Wiper Democratic Movement — Kenya (WDM-K) leader endorsed former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s presidential bid.
However, a simmering row over whether Raila would choose Musyoka as his running mate has seen critics speculate that the former VP might switch allegiances and join Ruto in the 9 August 2022 general election.
The DP did host an iftar dinner on 20 April 2022 at his residence in Karen, Nairobi, and shared images from the event on his Facebook timeline. However, none of the 75 images shared on Ruto’s Facebook timeline shows Musyoka or Sonko among the invited dignitaries.
On the other hand, a reverse image search reveals that the photo in question was taken at a different iftar dinner, which neither took place in 2022 nor was it hosted at Ruto’s residence in Karen, Nairobi, as claimed.
Among the search results is a tweet by the DP from 13 June 2018. Scrutiny of the photos contained in the tweet reveals the outfits worn by Ruto, Musyoka and Sonko are identical to the ones in the image in question. This indicates that the photos were taken at the same function.
Kenyan publications, including The Star and Kenyans.co.ke covered the 2018 iftar dinner. As indicated in Ruto’s tweet, both publications corroborate that the event took place on 13 June 2018.
The dinner was held at Charter Hall, in City Hall Nairobi. Musyoka also shared images of the said iftar dinner on his Facebook timeline and indicated that Sonko hosted the event.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post claiming to show former Vice President, Kalonzo Musyoka and Deputy President, William Ruto at an iftar dinner on 20 April 2022, and found it to be FALSE.
