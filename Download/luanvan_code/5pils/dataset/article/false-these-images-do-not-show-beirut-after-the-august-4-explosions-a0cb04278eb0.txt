A Facebook post with a collage of two images claiming to show Beirut before and after the August 4, 2020, explosions is MISLEADING.
On August 4, 2020, Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, was hit by a massive explosion caused by the accidental detonation of 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse at the city’s port. The explosions led to at least 200 fatalities and over 7,000 injured, with dozens still missing.
A Google reverse search on the first image of an urban coastline with multi-storey buildings shows the photo was published on various sites as early as 2017; in an article on Lebanon’s biggest cities, and two websites — depositphotos.com and shutterstock.com — which sell stock digital images.
The search result for the second image on TinEye shows the photo has been available on the internet since 2016.
The image was also published on a website selling souvenirs called Lebanon Postcard. The site uses the image of Beirut Port as an example of the high-resolution Google satellite maps they sell. However, no dates of the image were available.
Satellite images of Beirut taken by Planet Labs and shared side by side, show the state of the city before the blast on May 31, and after, on August 5, 2020.
The image, taken after the explosion, was also published on space.com.
PesaCheck looked into the post with a pair of images claiming to show Beirut before and after the August 4, 2020, explosions and found it to be MISLEADING.
