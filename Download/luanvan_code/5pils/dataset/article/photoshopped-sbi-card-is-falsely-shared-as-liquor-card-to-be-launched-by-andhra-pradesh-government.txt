A post with a photo is circulating on social media with a claim that the card shown in the photo is a 5000-rupees worth liquor card from Andhra Pradesh (AP) government. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of 5000-rupees worth liquor card from Andhra Pradesh government.
Fact: Photo shared as a liquor card from Andhra Pradesh government is photoshopped version of a State Bank of India (SBI) card. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.

From the article, it is understood that the photo is that of a State Bank of India (SBI) card. This SBI card was photoshopped and is being falsely shared as a liquor card from the Andhra Pradesh government.
