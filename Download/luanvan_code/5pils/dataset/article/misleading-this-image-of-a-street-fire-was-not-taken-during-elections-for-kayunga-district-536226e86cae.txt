A website article with an image purporting to show a street fire during the Kayunga District chairperson by-election is MISLEADING.
The article title reads, “Kayunga By- Election Exposes NUP’s Violence, Blackmail Political Bedrock…” It is accompanied by an image of a fire lit on the street during demonstrations.
However, a Google reverse search of the image reveals that it was taken in November 2020, during protests demanding that Ugandan authorities release the National Unity Platform (NUP) then-presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine.
Kyagulanyi was contesting in the January 2021 polls. The image is credited to AFP’s Badru Katumba.
The Kayunga seat fell vacant after the former district chairperson, Muhammad Sserubogo, committed suicide in June 2021.
As such, a by-election was held on 16 December 2021. The National Resistance Movement party candidate Andrew Muwonge was declared the winner, beating five other candidates, including NUP’s Harriet Nakwedde.
Police said they had arrested at least 81 people, including four members of parliament belonging to NUP, on allegations of trying to orchestrate violence during the by-election.
PesaCheck has looked into an article purporting to show an image of a street fire taken during the Kayunga District chairperson by-election and finds it to be MISLEADING.
