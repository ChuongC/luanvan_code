A photo of a football ground in the middle of the woods is being shared widely on social media with a claim that the ground is at Ukhrul in Manipur (India). Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of a football ground at Ukhrul in Manipur (India).
Fact: The football ground in the photo is not related to India. The photo shows a football ground in Russia. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo was run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same picture was found to be uploaded by multiple users with the claim that the photo is related to a football ground in Russia. ‘The Sun’ has also published a similar image with the following description – ‘Soccer in the Woods – gives a birds-eye view of Meshchersky Park, a recreation area just outside Moscow.’
The posted image can be also found in the ‘Google Maps’ photos of the football ground at Meshchersky Park in Russia. Also, many stock photos and videos related to the same ground can be found on the internet which mention that the ground is in Russia.
To sum it up, the football ground photo from Russia falsely shared as a football ground at Ukhral in Manipur (Russia).
