A Facebook post with an image said to be of beer cans rebranded as Pepsi, a soft drink, in order to drink alcohol at the World Cup tournament in Qatar is FALSE.
The post was made on 20 November 2022 as the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup opened in Qatar.
“Football lovers finding ways to drink alcohol at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Fans rebranded Heineken beer cans as Pepsi … to smuggle to the stadiums and other places after last minute ban on alcohol by Qatari Authorities,” the post reads.
The same image is posted by other Facebook users as seen here and here, with similar claims. In this post, the user alleges there have been restrictions in Qatar following the announcement that the country would be hosting the tournament and “observing Islamic rules”.
On all posts, a picture is attached of an individual peeling a can with branding similar to Pepsi to reveal that of the beer company, Heineken.
However, the claimed incident has not been reported by any international mainstream media house. A keyword search did not yield anything related to events in 2022.
PesaCheck conducted a Tineye reverse image search and found that the picture was first posted in November 2015. An article by Al Arabiya News shows the picture was taken when authorities in Saudi Arabia intercepted smugglers trying to sneak in alcohol into the country.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly of football lovers rebranding Heineken cans as Pepsi soda in order to drink alcohol at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar and found it to be FALSE.
