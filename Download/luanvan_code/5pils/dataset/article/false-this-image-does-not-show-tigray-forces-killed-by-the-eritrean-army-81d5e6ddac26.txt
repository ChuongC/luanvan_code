A Facebook post claiming to show the Eritrean army that killed more than 13,000 Tigray forces at Badme and Rama towns is FALSE.
The post attaches an image and a text in Amharic that translates, “Even though the terrorist group TPLF has launched a war against Eritrean forces in Badme and Rama last night, and the war continued till to 7:00 AM, the terrorist has left the war by sacrificing about 13,000 troops.”
Badme is a town at the centre of the Eritrean and Ethiopian border. Rama is a town in Tigray, Ethiopia.
For more than a year, the Ethiopian military, ethnic militias, and troops from neighbouring Eritrea have been fighting the TPLF in its stronghold in northern Ethiopia.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the images used to support the claim are unrelated to the conflict between the Eritrean and Tigray armies.
The Negative Colours website published the image on 26 June 2019, in the article titled, “Remembering the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border war.” The original image is also found through searches on TinEye and Yandex.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming the Eritrean army killed more than 13,000 Tigray forces at Badme and Rama towns of Ethiopia and finds it to be FALSE.
