This post on X (formerly Twitter) with photos supposedly comparing the first ladies of Uganda and Kenya is PARTLY FALSE.
The author juxtaposes the purported Ugandan first lady on the left and that of Kenya on the right.
Uganda’s first lady is Janet Museveni, who is also the Minister for Education and Sports. The Kenyan first lady is Rachel Ruto.
But are the photos authentic?
A Google reverse image search on the first picture established that it is of Ugandan human rights activist Stella Nyanzi, not Janet Museveni.
The Guardian published the photo of the activist in March 2020 and credited it to Sumy Sadurni, a Spanish photojournalist who was based in Uganda.

NTV Uganda also published the same image and identified the activist as Nyanzi, who is a former Makerere University lecturer.
Janet Museveni has been Uganda’s first lady since 1986. The first lady’s photos published on X are different from the claim photo we are debunking.
Google reverse image search results of the second image confirmed that it is of Rachel Ruto, the Kenyan first lady.
PesaCheck looked into a post on X (formerly Twitter) with two photos supposedly comparing Ugandan and Kenyan first ladies and found it to be PARTLY FALSE.
