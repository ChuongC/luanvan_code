This Facebook post with a photo supposedly of police dispersing a group protesting against the 2023 Finance Bill in Nairobi on 6 June 2023 is FALSE.
The 2023 Finance Bill seeks to amend Kenya’s taxation mechanism and is yet to become an Act of Parliament.
“Imebidi askari watumie mabomu ya machozi kutawanya mamia ya wanaopinga finance bill 2023 pale jijini Nairobi. (Police have had to use tear gas to disperse hundreds of people opposing the finance bill 2023 in Nairobi),” the post reads.
Some Kenyans took to the streets of Nairobi on Tuesday, 6 June 2023, protesting against the proposed legislation.
The protesters marched from Jeevanjee Gardens and the Kenya National Archives but they were dispersed before getting to Parliament, where they intended to present their grievances.
We performed a Google reverse image search to find out if the photo is of the 6 June 2023 protests. The result was that the photo was published in August 2020.
According to a Voice of America (VOA) article, the photo was taken in Nairobi during a protest over claims of misappropriation of COVID-19 resources in 2020.

Human Rights Watch and The Observer also published the photo in 2020.
