A Facebook image claiming to show over 2,000 Tegaru refugees arriving in Eritrea in July 2021, is FALSE.
The post in Amharic reads, “Tigrayan refugees flee to Eritrea. More than 2,000 Tegaru refugees marched to Eritrea last week, a source told the Eritrean Press. The Eritrean government is registering the refugees and providing them with humanitarian assistance and shelter, the source said”.
“After the Ethiopian National Defense Forces declared a ceasefire and withdrew from the Tigray region, the refugees crossed the border into Eritrea since the TPLF [Tigray People’s Liberation Front] terrorist group began killing innocent people known as “supporters of the interim administration,” the post adds.
The post is accompanied by a photo of people, some carrying flags, in a procession.
Since the beginning of the war in Tigray, more than 46,000 people have sought refuge in Sudan while 1.7 million have been displaced from their homes but remain within the region, according to a UNHCR report in July 2021.
However, reverse search results using the keywords “flag Eritrea” reveal the photo used to support the claim was published by a Twitter user in August 2019.
In addition, the image was used on 4 November 2020, by a website dubbed Ethiopian Intercept, in a post saying TPLF sought Asmara’s mediation with the Federal government.
“TPLF pleaded with Asmara to mediate with Addis Ababa, according to a source. However, the source said Eritrea has taken no notice of the message passed over from a third neutral country. In the last few days, Eritrean [sic] has moved its troops to Tigray and Gondar borders to monitor TPLF’s movement,” the Ethiopian Intercept states.
PesaCheck has looked into an image claiming to show over 2,000 Tegaru refugees arriving in Eritrea in July 2021, and finds it to be FALSE.
