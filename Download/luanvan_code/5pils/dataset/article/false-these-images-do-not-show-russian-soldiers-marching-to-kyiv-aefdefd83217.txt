A post claiming to show Russian forces marching to Kyiv through Belarus is FALSE.
The post published in Amharic translates in part, “Following President Putin’s command, Russian forces are marching to Kyiv through Belarus.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine on Thursday 24 February 2022. On the same day, Putin said that airports and military headquarters near cities across Ukraine were hit first, including the main Boryspil International airport near Kyiv.
However, reverse image search results here and here show that the photos have been used online in contexts unrelated to the Russia and Ukraine conflict.
The first image shows the Deccan Herald news website and was published on 12 December 2021. The photo credited to Reuters is featured in an article describing President Vladimir Putin’s views on the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The second image shows soldiers from Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan using new Russian firearms to conduct military drills close to the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border on 10 August 2021. The image credit is given to Reuters/Didor Sadulloev.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with images claiming to show Russian forces marching to Kyiv through Belarus and finds it to be FALSE.
