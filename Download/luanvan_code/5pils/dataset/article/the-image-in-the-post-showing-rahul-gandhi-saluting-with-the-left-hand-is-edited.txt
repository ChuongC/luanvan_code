A post with an image of Rahul Gandhi saluting with the left hand is being widely shared on Facebook. Let’s analyze the authenticity of that image.
Claim: Rahul Gandhi saluting with the left hand.
Fact: Image in the post is a ‘laterally inverted’ version of the photo that shows AICC General Secretary Rahul Gandhi saluting during the 65th Independence Day celebrations at the party headquarters in New Delhi. In the original image, Rahul Gandhi was saluting with the right hand. Hence, the claim is FALSE.
When the image in the post is cropped and subjected to Google Reverse Image Search technique, many search results with the same image were obtained but no credible information was obtained. But, when the image is ‘laterally inverted’ and is subjected to reverse image search, a link of ‘NDTV’ was obtained in the search results. The article in that link had the same image and it was found to be that from the flag-hoisting ceremony at Congress party headquarters in 2011 on the occasion of Independence day. In the original image, Rahul Gandhi was saluting with the right hand.
An image of ‘Getty Images’ during that ceremony also confirms that the image in the post is ‘laterally inverted’.
To conclude, the image in the post showing Rahul Gandhi saluting with the left hand is ‘laterally inverted’ to show the mirror image version.
