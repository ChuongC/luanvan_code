Publication Date:2020-09-21T13:18:09+00:00
A photo is being circulated on social media with a claim that the photo of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar with his wife is displayed on a bus in the US. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar with his wife displayed on a bus in the US.
Fact: Image shared in the post is a photoshopped one. On the original image of ‘Hop on Hop off’ city tour bus operating in the Bath city of England, no photo of Dr Ambedkar and his wife is displayed. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On the reverse image search, the original photo of the bus was found in ‘Wikimedia Commons’ website. In the website, it is mentioned as a tour bus operated by City Sightseeing service operator in Bath city, England. In the original photo of ‘Hop on Hop off’ city tour bus, no photo of Dr. Ambedkar or his wife is displayed on the bus. A similar photo of this tour bus operating in Bath city found in ‘Alamy’ website. In this image also, there is no photo of Dr Ambedkar with his wife on the bus.
On searching for the photo displayed on the bus, similar photo of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and his wife is found in an article published by ‘Forward Press’ website.
To sum it up, a photoshopped image of a tour bus in England is falsely shared as the bus displaying the photo of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar & his wife in the US.
