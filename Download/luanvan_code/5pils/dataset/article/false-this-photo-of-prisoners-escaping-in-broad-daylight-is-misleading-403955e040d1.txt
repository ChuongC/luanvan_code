A Facebook post with an image claiming to show inmates escaping from a Jinja prison in Uganda during the day is FALSE.
In the photo, inmates are seen running towards the entrance of a building with a prison warden behind them.
This photo, according to the social media user, shows “prisoners escape from jinja prison in Broad day light (sic)”.
A YouTube link is attached, inviting users to click and watch.
However, a Google reverse image search reveals that the photo does not show prisoners escaping from a prison in Jinja, eastern Uganda. The photo is of a protest by the inmates of Lira Central Prison, north of the country, on 13 February 2013.
It was taken by Reuters photographer Hudson Apunyo, as prison authorities quelled the protest and forced the inmates to run back to the cells.
Additionally, the link in the post claiming to show a YouTube video of the incident is clickbait — it is a music video.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show prisoners escaping in broad daylight from a Jinja prison in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
