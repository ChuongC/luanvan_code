A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Sudanese people protesting against their government is FALSE.
Published on Facebook, the photo has a text in Amharic that translates, “Sudanese are protesting requesting ‘our dignity has to be restored’. The Sudanes are protesting in the streets because of high inflation, among other reasons. The price of one bread in the country is estimated to be 50 Sudanese pounds.”
Reports published in March 2022, show Sudanese protesters decrying poor economic conditions as they march in cities across the country and the capital Khartoum, in continued demonstrations against military rule.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture used to advance the claim was published online before the protest by Sudanese people in 2022.
The image was published by the Guardian on 2 November 2021 in an article titled “Sudan’s coup has shattered the hopes of its 2019 revolution”. The caption states the photo, which was released on 30 October 2021, was taken during Sudanese anti-coup protesters gathering in the streets of Omdurman. The photo credit is given to AFP/Getty Images.
