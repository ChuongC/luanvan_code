A photo shared on Facebook purporting to show Kenya’s First Lady Rachel Ruto praying on a bus ferrying Heads of State to Queen Elizabeth’s funeral service is SATIRICAL.
The text accompanying the photo reads: “Her Excellency mama Rachel Ruto leading prayer session in the bus as they head to the queen of England’s funeral.”
President William Ruto and the First Lady travelled to the United Kingdom (UK) on 18 September 2022 to attend Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral.
The two were among hundreds of other leaders who visited the country to commiserate with the royal family and pay their last respects to the departed queen.
Due to the large number of leaders, the organisers opted for carpooling for security reasons. The Heads of State and other leaders were pooled together in buses and ferried to the event’s venue.
But did Ruto’s wife lead prayers on one of the buses ferrying the Heads of State?
We did a reverse image search and established that the original image did not show the First Lady praying.
Rachel Ruto is a dedicated Christian and has, on several occasions, been termed as a prayer warrior.
PesaCheck has examined a photo shared on Facebook purporting to show Kenya’s First Lady Rachel Ruto praying on a bus ferrying Heads of States to Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral service and finds it to be SATIRICAL.
