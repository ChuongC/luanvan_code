 An image of Bollywood actors Deepika and Ranveer is being shared on Facebook by many users claiming that they are supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party. Letâ€™s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
The archived version of the post can be found here.
Claim:  The picture shows that Deepika and Ranveer are working for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Fact:  It is a photo from the last year when the couple visited Siddhivinayak Temple, in Mumbai. The photo has been edited to insert the words favoring BJP. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the image in the post is run through a Google Reverse Image search, similar images can be found in the search results. The photo was taken in 2018 when the couple visited Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai. The photo has been edited to insert the words favoring BJP on the saffron shawl wore by them. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Finally, Deepika-Ranveer did not wear the BJP shawl. The picture is photoshopped.
