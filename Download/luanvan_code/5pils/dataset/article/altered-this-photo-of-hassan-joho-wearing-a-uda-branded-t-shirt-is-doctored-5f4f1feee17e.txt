This photo on Twitter featuring former Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho in a UDA-branded T-shirt has been ALTERED.
The photo captures Joho and Taufiq Balala, the Mombasa County Executive Committee member responsible for Transport, Infrastructure, and Public Works, viewing something on the phone. Joho is in a cap embroidered with his signature ‘Joho 001’ and a yellow T-shirt with the logo of Kenya’s governing party United Democratic Alliance (UDA).
The text accompanying the image reads: “Hassan Joho has seen the light, welcome to UDA mkuu(sir). Hustlers let us welcome him with a RETWEET(sic).”
The photo has also been shared here and here with the same content.
Joho publicly supported Raila Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja’s campaign against William Ruto’s UDA during Kenya’s 2022 general election.
However, as of 3 July 2023, a day after the tweet was shared, there are no reports of the former governor having shifted to the UDA camp.
Furthermore, considering the reference to Balala’s account in the photo, it seems the image was initially shared as a “story” on an Instagram account. In Instagram stories, users can tag each other and allow them to repost the same story on their account.
Upon reviewing Joho’s verified Instagram account, it is evident that the former governor posted an image of himself and Balala on one of his posts. However, in the original photo, Joho’s yellow T-shirt is plain and does not bear any UDA branding.
PesaCheck has reviewed a photo on Twitter featuring former Mombasa Governor Hassan Ali Joho wearing a UDA-branded T-shirt and found it to have been ALTERED.
