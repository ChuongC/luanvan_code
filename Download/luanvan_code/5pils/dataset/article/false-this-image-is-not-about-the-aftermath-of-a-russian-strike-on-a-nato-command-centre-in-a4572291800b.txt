This Facebook post claiming to show the aftermath of a Russian strike on a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) command centre in Ukraine is FALSE.
The post reads in part, “40 corpses, dozens more bodies remain under the rubble — details of the Russian “retaliation strike” on the NATO command center have appeared. A group of NATO officers and advisers was housed in a secret underground bunker built at a depth of 120 meters. More than 300 people in total.”
The post adds: “To date, 40 corpses have been recovered from the rubble of the headquarters, but most of the dead remain under the rubble.”
A reverse search of the image on Yandex established that the photo was featured in an article dated 7 March 2021 with the headline, “Published footage of the consequences of the “Tochka” strike on a fuel depot in Syria”.
According to the report, “more than 180 trucks and tankers were burned in the massive blaze, and at least four people killed and 24 wounded.”
On 24 February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine in what President Vladimir Putin termed as ‘special military operations’. This sparked the ongoing war.
According to a tally by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 8,490 civilians had been killed and 14,244 others injured as of 10 April 2023.
Ukraine is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). A look at the organisation’s map shows it has no official operation or mission in Ukraine.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image supposedly of the aftermath of a Russian strike on a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) command centre in Ukraine and finds it to be FALSE.
