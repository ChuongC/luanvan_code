The photo first used by The City Review Digital in its story “Sherikat youths invade Kampala park demanding jobs” is of a bus park found in Birendranagar, Nepal not Sherikhat, Juba
By Emmanuel Bida Thomas
A story by The City Review Digital, a local newspaper in South Sudan published on Saturday, 23rd October 2021 titled “Sherikat youths invade Kampala park demanding jobs” used a misleading image and caption depicting the Kampala bus park in Sherikhat Juba.

A reverse image search by 211 Check reveals that the picture is of a bus park in Birendranagar, Nepal. Nepal is a country in South Asia. 
Google Maps also shows the image as of April 2018 for the Bus Park in Birendranagar, Nepal.

The image and its caption in the story are misleading. The picture does not show the Kampala bus park in Sherikhat, Juba, it is a bus park in Birendranagar in Nepal, South Asia.
