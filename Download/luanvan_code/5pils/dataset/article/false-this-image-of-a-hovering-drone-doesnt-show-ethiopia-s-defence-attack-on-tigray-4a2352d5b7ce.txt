A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack by the Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) on Tigray forces is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates, “Breaking news. My dear brothers, the Special drone Fighter led by the Ethiopian Air Force today in Abergele’s town attack the Junta (TPLF) has entirely cleared the invading forces by drone.”
Fighting between ENDF and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) began in November 2020, and reports indicate thousands of people have been killed and others displaced by the conflict.
Recently, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) raised a red flag and said the body was, “concerned about rising tensions and reported sporadic fighting between forces of the Tigray Region and the Federal Government,” and called on “all parties to the conflict,” to show restraint and work “towards mutual understanding, tolerance, and peace.”
However, despite the prevailing tension, Google reverse image search results reveal that the claim photo is unrelated to the Ethiopian conflict.
The AIN Online website published the picture on 17 February 2015, in an article, “U.S. Export Policy Allows Wider Unmanned Aircraft Sales.” The image is credited to the U.S. Air Force.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) using drones to attack Tigray forces and finds it to be FALSE.
