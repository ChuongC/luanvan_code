An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Ethiopian Air Force attack on five trucks belonging to Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) force at Kobo town is FALSE.
The post in Afaan Oromo translates, “Breaking news: the Ethiopian Air force attacked five trucks belonging to the TPLF force travelling to Kobo town.”
Kobo is a town in northern Ethiopia, a region experiencing armed conflict pitting the TPLF and government forces since November 2020.
Thousands of people have been reported dead in the conflict. The United Nations Human Rights office said at least 108 civilians had been killed and many more injured in the northern Ethiopia of Tigray Region in January 2022.
In early December 2021, the TPLF withdrew from Ethiopia’s neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions.
Despite the ongoing conflict, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image is unrelated to the Ethiopian war.
Search results show that the Press Tv news website published the photo in an article, “As its grip unravels, Saudi unleashes bombing spree on Yemen’s Ma’rib”, on 07 November 2021. The photo description says it is an image of Saudi Arabian warplanes.
The image was also posted on the Alarabiya news website on 9 August 2018, in an article, “The air raid by the Arab coalition killed many Houthi leaders.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show that the Ethiopian Air Force attacked five trucks belonging to TPLF force at Kobo town and finds it to be FALSE.
