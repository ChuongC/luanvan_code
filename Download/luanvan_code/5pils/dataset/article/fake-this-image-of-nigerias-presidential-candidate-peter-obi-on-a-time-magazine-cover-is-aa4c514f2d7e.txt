A Facebook post with an image of Peter Obi, a candidate in Nigeria’s 25 February 2023 presidential elections purportedly featured in TIME Magazine, is FAKE.
The post reads, “Only 4 Nigerians have ever made the front page of TIME Magazine: Gowon, Sade Adu, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and now Peter Obi.”
“His Labour Party is favoured to win the Nigerian presidency, are Nigerians finally ready to retire the old order and chart a new course?” the kicker on the alleged cover reads.
The cover of the “special issue” magazine is dated Feb 21/Feb 28, 2023.
However, a review of TIME Vault, where the publication keeps a public record of its previous front covers, shows no edition featuring Obi in 2023.
The latest edition is dated “Feb 27/ March 6, 2023” and has a ChatGPT query on the cover.
The post claims that former Head of State Yakubu Gowon, singer Sade Adu and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organization, have also been on the front page of TIME Magazine. Out of the three, only Okonjo-Iweala has had a TIME front cover after being named among the 100 influential people in 2021.
Labour Party’s (LP) Obi was one of the presidential candidates in the 25 February 2023 Nigerian polls to replace President Muhammadu Buhari. All Progressive Congress (APC) candidate Bola Tinubu was, on 1 March 2023, declared president-elect by the country’s electoral referee.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post purportedly showing an image of Nigeria’s presidential candidate Peter Obi’s TIME Magazine feature and finds it to be FAKE.
