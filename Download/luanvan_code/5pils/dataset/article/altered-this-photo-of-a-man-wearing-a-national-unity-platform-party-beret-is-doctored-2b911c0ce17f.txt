This image on Facebook purportedly of a National Unity Platform (NUP) party official arrested for selling dog meat is ALTERED.
The screenshot in the post claims the man in the image is the Paya sub-county NUP chairman.
“After being disappointed by our NUP leader Bobi, I resorted to selling dog’s meat for survival, NUP chairman Paya subcounty,” the text in the screengrab reads.
The photo is of the purported “chairman” handcuffed near a carcass, a dog and wearing a red beret similar to the one used by NUP chairman Bobi Wine.
However, a Google reverse image search established that the image has been altered to include the red beret bearing NUP’s logo.
In the original image, the suspected dog meat seller is not wearing a red beret.
Additionally, the picture and story of that man were published by this website, but it does not identify him as a NUP leader.
PesaCheck has looked into an image on Facebook supposedly of a National Unity Platform party sub-branch chairman arrested for selling dog meat and found it to have been ALTERED.
