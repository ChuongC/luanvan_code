This tweet with an image purportedly of Ethiopian government forces drone attack on civilians in North Shoa, Amhara region in 2023, is FALSE.
The purported attack happened on 4 May 2023. The post reads: “Urgent information that we have just received 04.05.2023. Ethiopia at this time, the terrorist regime of Abiy Ahmed Ali has turned off the network and electricity in the entire North Shoa and is shooting at the people with weapons and drones.”
A section of civilians in Amhara protested against the April 2023 central government’s decision to disband and reassign members of regional special forces to either the federal army or the police.
There were also reports of internet blockage in Amhara following the directive on the disarmament of special forces. A Google search with the key words “electricity turned off, North Shoa, in Amhara region” yielded no viable results.
However, Google reverse image search results established that a photo of the drone used in the claim is old.
The image was published on the Daily Mail news website on 9 March 2013, together with the article, “US Drones bombing Africa operated from RAF bases in the heart of the Lincolnshire countryside.”
On 13 November 2017, Hurriyet Daily News website also published the image in an article describing the US drone strikes in Somalia.
PesaCheck has looked into the tweet with an image supposedly of a drone attack by the Ethiopian government on civilians in North Shoa, Amhara region and finds it to be FALSE.
