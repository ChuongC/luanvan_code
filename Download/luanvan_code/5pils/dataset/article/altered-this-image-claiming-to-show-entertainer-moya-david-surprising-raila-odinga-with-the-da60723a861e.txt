An image shared on Facebook claiming to show entertainer Moya David ‘surprising’ former Prime Minister Raila Odinga with the presidential results is ALTERED.
The image shows an elated Odinga dancing with the entertainer. A picture of President Uhuru Kenyatta, seated and looking on, is in the background.
Odinga is one of the four presidential candidates, who contested in the general elections on 9 August 2022.
On 15 August 2022, the chairman of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), Wafula Chebukati, declared Deputy President William Ruto the president-elect.
Moya David is an entertainer known for being sent to deliver surprise gifts, often amidst song and dance.
A reverse image search reveals that the original photo does not show Odinga or David as claimed.
Among the search results are articles by Kenyans.co.ke and pulselive.co.ke containing the image in question.
The photo captures the president-elect sharing a light moment with outgoing President Uhuru Kenyatta on the lawns of Ruto’s residence in Karen, Nairobi.
PesaCheck has examined the image claiming to show entertainer Moya David ‘surprising’ former Prime Minister Raila Odinga with the presidential results, and has found it to be ALTERED.
