A collage with a couple of photos is being shared on social media with a claim that the bandage dressing of Mamata Banerjee has been changed from her left leg to right leg. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photos show bandage of Mamata Banerjee changed from her left leg to right leg.
Fact: The photo of Mamata Banerjee in the wheelchair is a mirror image version of the original photo. The original photo has been modified to falsely show that the bandage is on her right leg. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the first photo in the post was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found to be published by multiple news agencies in their articles. Some of them can be seen here and here. The same photo was also tweeted by AITC leader Abhishek Banerjee on 11 March 2021. It can be observed that the photo was taken when Mamata Banerjee was admitted to the hospital. The bandage can be seen on the left leg of Mamata Banerjee.

The second photo was taken when Mamata Banerjee was discharged from the hospital on 12 March 2021. It can be observed that the photo in the post is a mirror-image version of the original. In the original photo posted by ‘Banglar Gorbo Mamata’, it can be seen that the bandage is on her left leg. But the photo is modified to falsely show that the bandage is on her right leg.

Also, in the video published by ‘ANI News’ with similar visuals, it can be seen that the bandage is on the left leg of Mamata Banerjee.
To sum it up, the photo of Mamata Banerjee in the wheelchair with a bandage on her right leg is a mirror image version of the original photo.
