A Facebook image claiming to show captured members of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) is ALTERED.
“These Shene combatants are captured and surrendered during a special operation in West Welega,” part of the post in Amharic reads. Shene refers to the Oromo Liberation Army.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image is doctored. Faces of the four individuals appearing in the original image were replaced with those of Ethiopian government officials.
The government officials whose faces appear in the photo are Takele Uma, the Minister of Mines; Shimelis Abdisa, the Oromia region president; Taye Dendea, the State Minister of Peace, and the fourth doctored face is of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
As seen in the screenshot below, the original image was shared on a Facebook page on 3 February 2022 and did not show the government officials’ faces.
The OLA is fighting against the Ethiopian government in the Oromia region.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show the captured members of the Oromo Liberation Army and found it to be ALTERED.
