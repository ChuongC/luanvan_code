A photo through post is being widely shared on social media claiming that the woman is the winner of ‘Miss India 2022’ which was won for the first time by a Banjara girl. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Miss India 2022 which was won for the first time by a Banjara girl.
Fact: The photo is of ‘Miss India’ 2022 winner from the Mr and Miss India 2022 Finals which was organised by Wings Models Hub. Wings Models Hub, according to its website, is a Modelling agency that organises Mr and Miss India competitions based on the registrations it receives. The winner name is Nikitha, but we could not verify if she belonged to the Banjara community. ‘Miss India’ competitions organised by Wings Model Hub is different from the more prominent ‘Miss India’ organised by Femina. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
When reverse image search is done on the photo, the same visual was found in a YouTube video. According to the video report, the visuals were part of Mr and Miss India 2022 Finals organised by the Wings Models Hub. Wings Models Hub, according to its website, is a Modelling agency that organises Mr and Miss India competitions based on the registrations it receives.
