This Facebook post claiming to show the Chinese army on high alert during Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates as; “Following Pelosi’s arrival to visit Taiwan, China’s Ministry of Defence announced that the country’s troops are being and waiting on high alert.”
As seen here and here, similar claims were shared by other social media users.
Nancy Pelosi has been the speaker of the United States House of Representatives since 2019. She held the same position from 2007 to 2011.
A picture that shows the troops and tanks is attached to the post. However, Google reverse image search results indicate that the image has no relation to Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, which China considers to be part of its territory.
The claimed picture was published on this website on 15 January 2019. “People’s Liberation Army troops prepare for a parade in September 2017 commemorating the PLA’s 90th anniversary. Photo from Defense Intelligence Agency 2019 China Military Power report,” the caption of the photo reads.
As seen here and here, the same image was shared on different websites in 2019.
Various reports, as seen here and here, indicate that Pelosi visited Taiwan in early August 2022 amid China’s protestation. China launched missiles near Taiwan after the Speaker’s trip to the Asian country.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post claiming to show the Chinese army on high alert during Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and finds it to be FALSE.
