This Facebook post with a link whose thumbnail image claims to show people affected by drought in Guji, Oromia region of Ethiopia in 2022 is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates as, “Due to the drought in the Oromia region, people are dying of hunger. It is known that twelve people died due to the famine in the Seba Boru District of Guji Zone.”
As seen here and here, the same link with the thumbnail image was shared by other social media users.
A link attached to the post directs to this website. The website contains a link that leads to the Reporter Amharic newspaper website. The site also contains news copied from the Reporter Amharic website. “Busa Gonofa’s office has announced that twelve people have died due to the famine that occurred in Seba Boru district of Guji zone in the Oromia region,” parts of the news item read. However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the claim image is unrelated to the drought in the Oromia region.
The picture was shared on the United Nations Africa Renewal website on 10 September 2019. The image was captioned; “Pastoralists moved to temporary sites close to permanent water point, as drought affected Ethiopia Somali region (2017).” Image credit is given to UNOCHA/Mulugeta Ayene.
As seen here, here, and here, other websites published the image.
On 12 July 2022, Addis Standard reported that 12 people had died in Guji, the Oromia region, owing to the effects of the drought.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with a link whose thumbnail image claims to show people affected by drought in Guji, the Oromia region of Ethiopia in 2022, and finds it to be FALSE.
