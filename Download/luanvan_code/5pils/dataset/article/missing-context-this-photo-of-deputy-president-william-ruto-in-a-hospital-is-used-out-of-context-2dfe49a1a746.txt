A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Kenya’s Deputy President William Ruto in hospital is MISLEADING.
The post claims the DP is “out of the country for his usual blood transfusion”, adding that despite being a “risky affair”, Mr Ruto “prefers the blood transfusion to taking pills to boost his deteriorating health”.
The photo was also used on Twitter, making similar claims, with some alleging the deputy president was secretly flown out of the country for urgent medical attention on November 20.
However, a Google reverse search shows the image is not recent and has been used before to make false claims about the Deputy President’s health.
The photo is in fact among a series posted by Dr Ruto on his official Facebook account, when he opened the Lunga Lunga sub-county hospital in Kwale, a county south of Mombasa, in August 2016.
Dr Ruto used the photo caption to explain that he was being treated after contracting the flu. He also posted photos of his visit on his official Twitter account on the same day.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show Kenya’s Deputy President William Ruto out of the country for medical treatment and finds it to be MISSING CONTEXT.
