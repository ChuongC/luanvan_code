A tweet with an image allegedly of Amhara genocide in the Oromia region of Ethiopia is FALSE.
The text accompanying the image reads: “#AmharaGenocideInOromia #AmharaUnderAttack Please Stand with poor Amhara farmers. Children and women dying in Ethiopia (Oromia Region).”
Fighting continues in Oromia between the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) and the Federal government. The media have reported civilian deaths as a result of the conflict between Amhara militias and OLA in Oromia.
Google and Yandex reverse image search results, however, showed that the claim image is unrelated to the conflict in Oromia.
As seen here, here, and here, the picture has been shared on different online platforms since 2016.
In addition, the image that was taken from a different angle is on the Getty Images website. The caption reads: “Rwandan Boy Crying Beside Dead Father. A young Rwandan boy cries and clings to his dead father, who died moments before of cholera. The two had fled the Hutu-Tutsi violence in Rwanda and came to Zaire for safety.” Image credit is given to David Turnley/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images and it was taken on 25 July 1994.
This is another picture of the same boy shared on the Getty Images website.
PesaCheck has examined the tweet with an image purportedly of Amhara genocide in the Oromia region of Ethiopia and found it to be FALSE.
