A Facebook post shared alongside three photos claiming to show police brutality during the enforcement of the dusk-to-dawn curfew ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta, is PARTLY FALSE.
The post criticises Kenyan police officers for using excessive force while enforcing the curfew order, saying that their actions would only increase the rate of infections.
However, a reverse image search of the first false image used alongside the post shows that it was taken during protests to call for the disbandment of Kenya’s electoral body, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The protests that took place in May 2016 were called by the then opposition coalition, Coalition for Reform and Democracy (CORD). The image is credited to Associated Press photographer Ben Curtis and shows a policeman kicking a protestor after he fell while running.
A reverse image search on the third image on the post shows that is credited to Reuters photographer Goran Tomasevi, and was also published in May 2016. It shows protestors surrounded by police officers wielding batons.
The second image is authentic, as it shows an unidentified man lying on the ground having sustained what appears to be baton wounds. While the photo is not credited to any one photographer, a reverse image search shows it was first published on March 28, 2020, a day after the 7pm to 5am curfew was introduced.
PesaCheck has looked into photos used in a post criticising police brutality during Kenya’s dusk to dawn curfew and finds them to be PARTLY FALSE.
