An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Kenya’s Deputy President William Ruto, and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga in a ‘midnight meeting’ is FALSE.
The image was shared on April 12, 2021, amid speculation about an alliance between the two politicians following a meeting between DP Ruto and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya.
The post does not provide any other details about the meeting, including when or where the image was taken.
PesaCheck found a similar image taken from a different angle published on the deputy president’s Facebook page on January 7, 2015. The post accompanying the image states that Mr Ruto had visited to console Mr Odinga’s family following the death of the former premier’s son, Fidel Odinga. The image was not taken during a midnight meeting by the two politicians as the post in question claims.
PesaCheck has looked into the image shared on Facebook claiming to show Kenya’s Deputy President William Ruto, and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga in a ‘midnight meeting’, and finds it to be a FALSE.
