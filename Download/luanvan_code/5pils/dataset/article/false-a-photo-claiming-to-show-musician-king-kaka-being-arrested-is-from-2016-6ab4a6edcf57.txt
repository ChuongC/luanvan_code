A Facebook post claiming that Kenyan musician Kennedy Ombima, also known as King Kaka, has been arrested is FALSE.
The post contains a photo of King Kaka in handcuffs and surrounded by police, adding that the musician was locked up at Kamiti Prison, leaving behind an expectant wife.
This is after the musician released ‘Wajinga Nyinyi’, a song critical of Kenyan leaders and voters, that also mentioned a number of corruption cases and started an online conversation over the subject matter of the song and its accompanying video.
However, the photo used alongside the post claiming that King Kaka had been arrested is actually a still from the video of ‘Thug Love’, which he released in October 19, 2016.
A reverse image search on the second image used in the post reveals that it was first shared on Instagram by King Kaka’s wife Nana Owiti, on September 27, 2017.
Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has demanded an apology from the musician, instructing him to permanently delete the song on all social media platforms, admit liability for damages to her and unconditionally confirm and commit never to release any further defamatory songs against her.
According to the governor, the allegations made against her on the song, which include irregular procurement and loss of public funds during her tenure as Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Devolution are false, mischievous and malicious, with no basis.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Kenyan Musician, King Kaka has arrested over his ‘Wajinga Nyinyi’ song and finds it to be FALSE.
