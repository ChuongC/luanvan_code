An image of an injured boy is being shared widely on social media with a claim that he was injured in Delhi violence. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of a boy injured in Delhi violence.
Fact: The photo was taken in Syria in February 2018. It is not related to the recent Delhi violence. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.    
When the image was searched using Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found on the ‘Getty Images’ website. On that website, the photo has the following description: ‘A wounded Syrian boy covered in blood waits to receive treatment at a make-shift hospital in Kafr Batna in the besieged Eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus following Syrian government bombardments on February 21, 2018’. So, the boy was not injured in Delhi and the photo is not related to Delhi violence.
To sum it up, the boy is not from Delhi and the photo is not related to Delhi violence. The photo is of an injured Syrian boy.
