A picture of a rubble used in a Facebook post to show the destruction of Axum airport in the Tigray region by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces is FALSE.
The post claims that TPLF forces fled as the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) advanced into the ancient city, and destroyed the historical and modern Axum airport.
Axum, one of the oldest towns and the most favourable tourist destinations in Ethiopia, is among cities seized by the ENDF from TPLF forces, in the ongoing conflict between the regional and federal governments.
Members of the defence force told Fana Broadcasting Corporation that some spots within the Axum airport were damaged and its runway was dismantled using bulldozer and grader machines by TPLF forces.
However, none of the pictures in the post shows the destruction of Axum airport. A reverse image search shows the first image is actually Tripoli’s airport, which was completely destroyed by consecutive clashes between rival Libyan militias in 2014. The second post shows the Donetsk Airport in Ukraine, which was destroyed by six months of war in 2015.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that a picture shared on Facebook shows destruction at the airport of Axum in the Tigray region by TPLF forces, and finds it to be FALSE.
