On Facebook, a few users are posting a photo of Trump holding an official document that has an image of Ambedkar on the left and the text “jai bhim” with Trump’s signature on the right side. In the post, it is claimed that Donald Trump was inspired by the books of Ambedkar and he expressed his wish to embrace Buddhism. Let’s try to verify the claims made in the post.
Claim: Trump was holding an official document that has an image of Ambedkar on the left and the text ‘jai bhim’ with his signature on the right.
Fact: President Trump’s executive order to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership is photoshopped with the image of Ambedkar on the left and text ‘jai bhim’ on the right. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.  
When the photo in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search technique, it was found in an article of ‘Forbes’ published in January 2017. The photo in the article carried the following description- “President Trump shows signed executive ordering withdrawing U.S. from Trans-Pacific Partnership WASHINGTON, DC”.
When searched if Trump has expressed anytime his wish to embrace Buddhism, no corroborating information was found.
So, the photo of Trump with a document carrying Ambedkar’s photo and text ‘jai bhim’ is a photoshopped one and also, Donald Trump hasn’t expressed any wish to embrace Buddhism anytime.
