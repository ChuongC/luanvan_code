A post accompanying an image of a lush green terraced hill is being shared with a claim that the image shows a landscape in Nauradhar village in Himachal Pradesh. Through this article letâ€™s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of terraced hill landscape from Nauradhar village in Himachal Pradesh.
Fact: The image actually shows a terraced rice field in Mu Cang Chai, Vietnam. Multiple blogs and stock image repositories identify the landscape as from Vietnam. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Reverse image search of the photo led us to a blog which identified the landscape as from Vietnam. Further search yielded multiple travel blogs which shared a similar image identifying the landscape as a terraced rice field in Mu Cang Chai, Vietnam. These blogs can be seen here, here.
Taking a cue from these blogs, a search for stock images with relevant keywords yielded an image on Getty images which is almost similar to the one shared in the post. As per the description, the image shows rice fields in Mu Cang Chai, Vietnam. Few more similar stock images can be seen here, here & here.
Although there are terraced hills in Nohradhar of Sirmour district of Himachal Pradesh, Google search did not yield any image similar to the viral image. All these establish the landscape is indeed in Vietnam but not in Himachal Pradesh.
To sum it up, this image of terraced hills is from Vietnam, not Himachal Pradesh.
