This Facebook post with images claiming to show public protests against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in Adigrat in August 2022 is MISSING CONTEXT.
The post in Afaan Oromo shared on 23 August 2022 reads in part: “Reports coming from the north confirm that people living in Adigrat have staged a protest today against TPLF forces destabilising peace and stability of the region.”
The post adds: “TPLF is the enemy of Tigray and the Ethiopian people. TPLF is sacrificing the people for a struggle that hasn’t benefited the people.”
Three images accompany the post, with the first showing people in lines holding TPLF flags in what appears to be a public demonstration. The second and third images show people in the streets with smoke billowing in the background.
The images are also shared here and here.
TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda said at a press conference [minute 11:50] on 18 August 2022 that “the ceasefire has been technically ended as the government forces have attacked TPLF forces using artillery”.
Reuters reported on 24 August 2022 that fighting had erupted between Tigray forces and Federal government soldiers near Kobo, north Wollo Zone in Amhara regional state.
The Ethiopian government and Tigray forces unilaterally declared a ceasefire in June and July 2021 respectively.
However, the images we are investigating do not show people in Adigrat, a town in the eastern Tigray region, protesting against TPLF in August 2022, as claimed.
Results of a reverse image search for the first photo show public demonstration in September 2020. The image was shared on Twitter with a statement in Somali indicating there was a public gathering in Adigrat in September 2020.
Reverse image search results for the second and third pictures also reveal the images depicted demonstrations in Adagirat in 2020. The two images were shared here in May 2020, with a caption in Amharic reading: “Protests held in Adigrat against the TPLF regime”.
A conflict reporter also debunked the two images being shared on social media, stating they show previous protests.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with images claiming to show protests held against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in Adigrat in August 2022 and finds it to be MISSING CONTEXT.
