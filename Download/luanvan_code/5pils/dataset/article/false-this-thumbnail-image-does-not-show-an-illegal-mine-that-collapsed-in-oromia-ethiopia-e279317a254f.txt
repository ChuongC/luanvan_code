A thumbnail image shared on Facebook claiming to show an illegal mine that collapsed and killed seven people in the Oromia region, Ethiopia, is FALSE.
“At least seven people were killed after an illegal mine collapsed in Ethiopia’s Oromia regional state, officials said Tuesday,” the post reads.
The Fana Broadcasting Corporate S.C. (FBC) reported the accident, saying, “Seven people have died in a landslide while they were mining gold in eastern Bale, Gololcha district,” in its report in Amharic. Also, other media outlets like Addis Standard and The Manila Times have made a similar report.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the thumbnail image of the Africa News website does not show an illegal mine that collapsed in the Oromia region, Ethiopia.
The attached link to the claim directs to the Africa News website. And on the website, the description of the image says it refers to an incident in Sudan. This report did not give any information on how this image is related to the accident in Ethiopia.
The same image was shared on the TRT World and CNN websites. The description of the image on the websites states, “People gather as victims from a collapsed gold mine are buried on Dec. 28, 2021, in Kordofan, Sudan.” Image credit is given to Sudanese Mineral Resources Limited Company / AP.
