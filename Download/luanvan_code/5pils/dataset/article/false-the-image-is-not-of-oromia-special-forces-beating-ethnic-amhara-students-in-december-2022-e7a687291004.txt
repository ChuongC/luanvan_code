This tweet with an image purportedly of ethnic Amhara students being beaten by Oromia Special Forces in December 2022 is FALSE.
The Amharic text accompanying the image reads: “Look at the price that Amhara students are paying. Oromia’s special forces beat and kill whoever they want. These children are some of the Amhara students killed by the special force of the Oromia region.”
The Oromia Special Forces are the regional state security force of Oromia.

On 10 December 2022, the National Movement of Amhara issued a statement about the attacks against the Amhara in the Oromo region.
However, a Google reverse image search established that the image we are fact-checking has been online since 2016 in contexts unrelated to the Amhara students.
The Human Rights Watch website published the image on 21 February 2016 with the caption: “Security forces harassing students in Oromia during a protest in January 2016.”
PesaCheck has looked into the tweet with an image apparently of ethnic Amhara students being beaten by Oromia Special Forces in December 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
