No, all the kids in the photo are not the children of that old man - FACTLY

A photo of an old man with many kids around him is being shared widely with the claim that the man in the photo has 3 wives and 32 children, who all live in a single hut. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of an old man with his 3 wives and 32 children.
Fact: The photo shows an old man with his 37 other family members that includes his children and grandchildren. Not all the kids in the photo are his sons and daughters. Hence, the claim is FALSE. 
When the image in the post was subjected to Yandex reverse image search technique, it was found in a video of ‘The Print’ news channel. The video has the title ‘एक झोपड़ी में रहते हैं 38 लोग, सरकारी योजना के तहत घर न मिलने से नाराज़’. The English translation of it is- ‘38 men live in a single hut and are disappointed as the government isn’t sanctioning a house to them’.
In the video, the old man said that he lives in the hut along with his 4 children and grandchildren, but hasn’t stated anywhere that he has 3 wives and 32 children (his sons and daughters). So, it is a false claim.
To summarize, not all the kids seen in the photo are the children of that old man.
