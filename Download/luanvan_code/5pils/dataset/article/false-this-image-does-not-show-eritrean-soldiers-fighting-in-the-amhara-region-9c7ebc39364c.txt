A Facebook image post claiming to show Eritrean soldiers fighting and looting in the Amhara region of Ethiopia is FALSE.
The image shows several uniformed officers lining up. The image text claims these are “Eritrean troops fighting alongside Ethiopian federal forces in and around Gondar city of the Amhara region”. The text adds, “Reportedly, the Amhara militias are fighting with Eritrea/ENDF forces to stop the reported civilian’s lootings”.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture is unrelated to the war in the northern parts of Ethiopia which erupted in 2020. Instead, the image shows when Eritrean soldiers marched to celebrate the border reopening between Ethiopia and Eritrea on 11 September 2018.
The image was published on the TRT World’s website on 16 November 2018, and credit was given to AFP. The image also features on Voice of Nigeria’s (VON) website, with the caption indicating these were Eritrean soldiers as they crossed over to attend the border reopening ceremony. The ceremony saw the reopening, for the first time in 20 years, of two land border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
At the beginning of the conflict in November 2020, both Ethiopian and Eritrean authorities denied allegations that Eritrean troops were involved. But as the war raged on, both countries admitted the Eritrean troops’ involvement. There have also been allegations of Eritrean troops looting.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show Eritrean soldiers who are fighting and looting in the Amhara region and finds it to be FALSE.
