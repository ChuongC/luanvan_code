A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a vehicle belonging to former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, and alleging it was damaged in Siaya county, Kenya is FALSE.
The image shows a close-up of what appears to be a tyre blowout while the post accompanying the photo claims Mr Odinga’s car was “badly involved in an accident in Siaya” during a BBI campaign tour.
But the claim in the post, published on December 1, has not been covered by any local media outlets, raising red flags that it may be false. As a high profile political figure in Kenya, any accident involving Mr Odinga’s car would have been widely covered by the media.
An internet search brings up a similar image that was tweeted by the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The tweet indicates that the vehicle in the picture belongs to National Unity Platform (NUP) party’s presidential candidate, Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine.
The damage is said to have occurred when police allegedly shot at Mr Kyagulanyi’s car as he campaigned in the southeastern region of Jinja, Uganda, on December 1, 2020.
The post includes other images which were also tweeted by Mr Kyagulanyi showing the full car and damages to other parts of the vehicle as well.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s damaged car in Siaya county, Kenya, and finds it to be FALSE.
