This post on X (formerly Twitter) with an image of a woman walking down the staircase of a partly destroyed building is MISSING CONTEXT.
The photo, shared on 12 November 2023, shows a woman carrying a toy car and is accompanied by text that reads: “You can’t Break the Palestinian spirit.”
The same claim has been shared here.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the photo was taken in Homs, Syria.
The photo is credited to photographer Hassan Ghaedi. According to the photographer, the narrative behind the image is that a mother revisited her former home and found her son’s toy car.
The photo won the Siena International Photo Awards and was published on the photographer’s Instagram page. According to the post, the image was captured in June 2016.
The ongoing war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas erupted on 7 October 2023.
PesaCheck has looked into a post on X (formerly Twitter) with an image of a woman walking down the staircase of a destroyed building and finds it to be MISSING CONTEXT.
