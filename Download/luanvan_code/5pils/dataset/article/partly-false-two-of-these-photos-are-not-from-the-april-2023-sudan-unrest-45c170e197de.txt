This Facebook post with photos supposedly of the unrest in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital on 16 April 2023, is PARTLY FALSE.
The first two images are of a bridge on fire and a building ablaze, while the last photo is of a plane also on fire.
“Yajama this Khartoum fire,” the text accompanying the photos reads.
The unrest in Sudan began on 15 April 2023, after the country’s military and a paramilitary group dubbed Rapid Support Forces (RSF) clashed in the capital city.
But, are these photos representatives of the situation in Khartoum?
A Google reverse image search on the first two photos established that they were taken during the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict and not in Khartoum.
The first photo is of the Kerch Bridge, which was bombed in October 2022. It was also published here and here.
The second photo is of an apartment torched in Mariupol, Ukraine, on 11 March 2022. The image was also published here and here.
For the third photo, a Google reverse image search confirmed that it is from Khartoum and taken during the ongoing unrest.
According to the Arabian Business, the photo is of a Saudia plane “caught on fire” in Sudan, prior to its departure to Riyadh. The images also appeared here and here.
News of the plane’s destruction was also published by media outlets, including Reuters and France 24.
PesaCheck has examined a Facebook post with photos supposedly of the unrest in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital on 16 April 2023, and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
