An image shared on Facebook claiming to show former Kenya’s Prime Minister, Raila Odinga, napping during a United States tour is ALTERED.
The post was published on 24 April 2022. “Raila Odinga in USA…he will wake up on Sunday…atakuta tumezika Kibaki… [he will find Kibaki has already been buried] Reject Azimio. Reject project Raila,” reads the post accompanying the image.
Odinga, the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya presidential candidate, led a delegation of political allies on a US trip on 22 April 2022. According to a statement by Makau Mutua, the spokesperson of Odinga’s presidential campaign secretariat, the visit saw him outline his vision for Kenya, foreign policy, and fellowship with Kenyans abroad.
Odinga returned to the country ahead of the requiem mass of the late former President, Mwai Kibaki, on 29 April 2022.
A reverse image search reveals that the image was neither taken in 2022 nor during Odinga’s trip to the US. An article by zimbio.com containing a similar image showing Odinga wearing the same name tag is among the image results.
According to the caption, the image was taken on 7 August 2012 and shows Odinga during a visit to the Kenya National House in London, England. The image is credited to Getty Images photographer Chris Jackson.
PesaCheck has examined the image claiming to show former Prime Minister, Raila Odinga, taking a nap during his April 2022 tour in the US, and found it to be ALTERED.
