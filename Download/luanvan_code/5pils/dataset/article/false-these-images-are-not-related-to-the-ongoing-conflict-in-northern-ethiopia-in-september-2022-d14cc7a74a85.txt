This Facebook post with images purporting to show Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) militants who surrendered on 25 September 2022 is FALSE.
The post, in Amharic, dates the claimed event as “25 September 2022” in the headline.
“These aren’t human waves. It shows TPLF militants who are surrendering to our allied forces massively,” part of the post reads, adding: “There were many who didn’t get this opportunity and were eaten by wild animals. It is not late yet to surrender.”
The post was also shared here and here.
The post is accompanied by two images. The first shows a massive gathering of people, and the second depicts people walking in a line.
In late November 2021, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed called on TPLF forces to surrender, after months of fighting which broke out in November 2020.
After a failed cease-fire, fighting resumed on 24 August 2022. Ethiopian government officials have accused the TPLF of utilising human waves as a military strategy in the ongoing war against federal forces in northern Ethiopia.
On 18 September 2022, Fana Broadcasting Corporate (FBC), the Ethiopian government affiliated broadcaster, reported that TPLF militants surrendered to the Ethiopian National Defence Force.
However, the images we are looking into don’t show TPLF militants surrendering to federal allied forces on 25 September 2022 as claimed.
Google reverse image search results for the two images here and here show they depict TPLF militants who reportedly surrendered in August 2021.
The images were first shared by the FBC in December 2021, along with this caption in English: “#Ethiopia: Thousands of soldiers of terrorist #TPLF are surrendering following PM Abiy’s call”.
The two images were also featured in a report by the Ethiopian News Agency website indicating militants had surrendered in December 2021.
PesaCheck has investigated the Facebook post with images claiming to show TPLF militants who surrendered on 25 September 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
