The Facebook image claiming to show Taye Dendea, a state minister for Peace, is ALTERED.
“Did the Minister of Peace, Tayeche, eat her dinner?” the post in the Amharic language asks. The post has changed the name of Taye to “Tayeche”, the feminine form of the name Taye. Also, it is referring to him as a woman and added the prefix Mrs.
However, a Google reverse image search reveals that the image does not show Taye. The image is created by digitally manipulating images of Taye and Muferiat Kamil.
One of the original images that was used to create the doctored image shows Muferiat, who currently serves as the Minister of Labour and Skills (MoLS) of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and is a former Minister of Peace.
The second original photo is a portrait of Taye which is reversed in the final image.
Thus, the image under investigation, which was shared along with the Facebook post on 3 November 2021, is doctored and has been created by digitally combining these two images.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show Taye Dendea, Ethiopian State Minister for Peace, and finds it to be SATIRICAL.
