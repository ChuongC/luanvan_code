An image shared on Facebook claiming to show a woman fetching water in Igembe Central Constituency in Kenya is FALSE.
The image shows the woman reaching into a water well from a prostrate position on the ground and with three containers beside her.
The post accompanying the image states that the photo shows how dire the water situation is in Njia Ward, Igembe Central, in Meru County. The post adds that all the residents required is for Governor Kiraitu Murungi to address their plight and sort out the water shortage in the area.
The image has also been shared by other Facebook users including here, here, here, and here.
However, a reverse image search shows that the photo was not taken in Meru County as claimed.
Among the search results are articles published on websites of a number of charity organisations in West Africa, such as Water Charity and AETM (Amiti√© Embrun Tiers-Monde). While the features highlight the charity work in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burkina Faso, and Central African Republic (CAR), none of them has captioned the image or attributed it to any particular photographer.
However, an article by 27avril.com, a Togolese online publication, dated 23 March, 2017, about how African countries have performed poorly in the happiness index, contains a caption of the image.
The caption states that the woman was photographed in the Dapaong region of northern Togo.
PesaCheck has looked into the image claiming to show a woman fetching water in Igembe Central Constituency, Kenya, and finds it to be FALSE.
