An image on Twitter supposedly of Ethiopian historian and social media activist Taye Bogale on the cover of the book, The way of Medemer, is ALTERED.
The image is accompanied by an Amharic text translated as; “A story of prosperity [Prosperity Party] that generations will read.”
Medemer is a non-fiction book by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. The first edition was published in 2019. In May 2021, Abiy published the second edition.
The third part of the book (The Generation of Medemer) was published in March 2023.
Taye is a social media activist who regularly comments on politics and other issues in Ethiopia.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the image is digitally manipulated.
The original cover image of The Way of Medemer is Abiy’s. The image was published on the PM’s Twitter page on 5 May 2021.
PesaCheck has examined an image on Twitter purportedly of Ethiopian historian and social media activist Taye Bogale on the cover of The Way of Medemer and finds it to be ALTERED.
