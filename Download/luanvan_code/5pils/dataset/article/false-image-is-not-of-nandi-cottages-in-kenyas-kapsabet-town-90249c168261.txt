A Facebook post with an image claiming to be of Nandi cottages in Kapsabet town, Kenya, is FALSE.
The image is of a brightly-lit building towering over the rest of the cityscape.
A search on Google map shows that Nandi cottages are situated along the Nandi Hills-Kapsabet road in Kenya. A Google street view snapshot indicates it is a rural-esque area, not a cityscape as shown in the image in question.
A reverse image search points out that the photo is of Marina Bay Sands, a resort hotel in Singapore.
The image was initially shared on Instagram by Singaporean photographer Benny Tang on 31 December 2020.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to be of Nandi cottages in Kenya’s Kapsabet town, and found it to be FALSE.
