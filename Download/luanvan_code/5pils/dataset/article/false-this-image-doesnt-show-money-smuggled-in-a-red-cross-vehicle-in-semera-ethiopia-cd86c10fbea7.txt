A Facebook post with an image claiming to show money smuggled in a vehicle bearing the logo of the International Committee of the Red Cross is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates into; “Shameful News! Stealing while waving the Red Cross logo is very shameful. In the Afar region, Semera, cash found in illegal trafficking has been seized by the security forces.”
Semera, the capital of Afar Regional State of Ethiopia, is situated along the Ethio-Djibouti highway.
On 30 July 2022, Fana Broadcasting Corporation reported that more than ETB 8.8 million was seized in a Red Cross vehicle carrying humanitarian aid en route to the Tigray region through Afar.
The Red Cross condemned the illegal transfer of cash and goods by humanitarian aid trucks.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image is unrelated to the millions of ETB seized in a vehicle with the Red Cross logo in Afar in July 2022.
The image was posted on the Alarabiya News website on 27 December 2016, in an article with the title; “Egyptian arrested after receiving bribes worth $8 million.”
The Phoenix FM website, on 22 February 2022, also published the image, in an article; “Money recovered from faith Musonda Channelled towards student bursaries.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show smuggled and impounded money under the cover of Red Cross and finds it to be FALSE.
