Many Facebook users are sharing a post alleging that WikiLeaks has disclosed that Rahul Gandhi was married to a Columbian and they even have two children aged 14 & 10. Let’s try to analyze the veracity of the claims made in the post.
Claim 1: WikiLeaks disclosed that Rahul Gandhi was married to a Columbian and they even have two children Niyak (14) & Mainak (10) 
Fact: WikiLeaks hasn’t disclosed anything regarding Rahul Gandhi’s marriage. The lady with Rahul Gandhi seen in the photo is a Spanish actress Nathalia Ramos. Hence the claim made in the post stands FALSE.    
When searched in WikiLeaks.org regarding Rahul Gandhi’s marriage, no relevant information was found. When the photo in the post was cropped and run through Google Reverse Image technique, it was found in a tweet from a Spanish actress, writer and  political scientist, Nathalia Ramos. She tweeted about her meeting with Rahul Gandhi on September 14,2017. Her photo with Rahul Gandhi is now being shared with a false narrative.
Several fake news has been floating on social media regarding Rahul Gandhi right from his filing of nomination for the 2019 general elections.
To sum it up, WikiLeaks hasn’t disclosed anything about Rahul Gandhi’s marriage. It is a fake news.
