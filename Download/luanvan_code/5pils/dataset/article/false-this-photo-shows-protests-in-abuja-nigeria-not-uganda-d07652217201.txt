A photo shared on Facebook claiming to show protests in Kampala, Uganda is FALSE.
The photo is captioned: “Kampala is burning. Museveni must free Bobi Wine.” It shows a face-off between police on one side and protesters on the other.
But a reverse image search shows that the image was taken during a confrontation between police and anti-police brutality protesters in Abuja, Nigeria, prompting the officers to fire teargas canisters.
The photo has been used in an article published by the New York Times on October 20 and is credited to Kola Sulaimon of the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
Nigeria was rocked by days of nationwide protests following widespread claims of extortion, harassment, and kidnappings by a controversial police unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).
The protests began on October 7, 2020 with mostly young people demanding the scraping off of the police unit. On October 21, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said the protests had claimed the lives of 69 people across the country.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared on Facebook claiming to show protests in Kampala, Uganda and finds that it is FALSE.
