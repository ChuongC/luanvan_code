An image posted to Facebook claiming to show a drone attack on the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces is FALSE.
“The Ethiopian Defence Force drones attacked TPLF forces in three different places in the Tigray region,” the post in Amharic reads.
There have been reports of airstrikes in Tigray since the start of January 2022. On 14 January 2022, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) said at least 108 civilians were killed in the strikes.
On 16 January 2022, the TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda in a tweet decried drone attacks on three different areas in the Tigray region.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo of a drone used with the claim has been used online to illustrate different reports.
The image was published on 29 September 2020 on the Aviation Image Library website. The image is credited to John Kilmer with a caption that reads “General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper”.
The image was also posted on the Defence View news website on 11 December 2021, in an article describing the MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show a drone attack on the TPLF forces and finds it to be FALSE.
