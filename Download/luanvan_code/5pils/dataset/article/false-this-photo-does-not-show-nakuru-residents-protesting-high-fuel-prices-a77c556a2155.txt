A tweet claiming to show residents in Nakuru, Kenya, protesting against high fuel prices is FALSE.
The tweet is accompanied by a photo of a crowd standing in the middle of a road, with some holding hands. And this crowd, the author claimed, showed Nakuru residents demonstrating the fuel price hike.
“Happening now in Nakuru, Shabaab, wananchi (citizens) revolting against HIGH FUEL PRICE. JOIN THE REVOLUTION #FuelPrices #Rubis,” the tweet, published on 15 September 2021, reads.
However, a reverse image search on TinEye reveals that the photo is old. The Star newspaper published it in an article on 6 June 2016.
Additionally, those pictured were not protesting against a hike in fuel prices but advocating for the removal of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) commissioners.
“Cord supporters from Kibera in Nairobi county during demonstrations for the forceful removal of commissioners at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, June 6, 2016,” reads the caption of the photo, taken by Collins Kweyu.
On 14 September 2021, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) revised the prices of petroleum products upwards.
“Super Petrol, Diesel and Kerosene will now retail at Kshs. 134.72, Kshs. 115.60 and Kshs. 110.82 per litre respectively in Nairobi starting today midnight,” the EPRA announced the new prices on their Twitter account.
A litre of petrol, diesel and kerosene increased by Sh7.58, Sh7.94 and Sh12.97, respectively.
The new prices caused an uproar among some Kenyans, one of them being the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli. Mr Atwoli warned the government to prepare for unrest from all quarters.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet claiming to show a photo of Nakuru residents protesting against the high fuel prices and finds it to be FALSE.
