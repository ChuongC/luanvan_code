This photo on Facebook post of a road in Nairobi supposedly cleaned by sweeping trucks acquired by Governor Johnson Sakaja’s administration in 2023 is FALSE.
The photo was also shared by Sakaja on his official account in reaction to a tweet on the acquisition of the sweeping trucks.
In the post, Sakaja captioned the photo using “cheki”, slang which is translated as “see”.
However, our Google reverse image search established that the photo is old, having been previously published here in July 2020.
According to a Kenyans.co.ke article published on 4 July 2020, the image is of Kimathi Street after its rehabilitation by the Nairobi Metropolitan Service (NMS).
PesaCheck looked into a photo shared on a Facebook post of a Nairobi street cleaned by sweeping trucks recently acquired by Governor Johnson Sakaja’s administration and found it to be FALSE.
