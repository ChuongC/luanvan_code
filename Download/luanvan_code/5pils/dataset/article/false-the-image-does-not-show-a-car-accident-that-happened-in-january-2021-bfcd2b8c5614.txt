A Facebook post claiming that a car accident claimed the lives of 27 commuters in Addis Ababa in January 2021 is FALSE.
The post claims further that on January 16, 2021, the Anbessa Bus with registration number A68377, had 58 people on board and was travelling from Shiro Meda to Kasanches when it collided with another vehicle registered as a private car and “code 3.” Rental cars are called code 3 vehicles because they are required to get a code 3 licence plate from the government, permitting them to provide the service.
The bus crashed below the bridge on St Stefanos Church Street, claiming the lives of 27 passengers, while 15 others were injured and taken to Zewditu Memorial and Menelik II Hospitals, the post adds.
Users are then requested to share the content to help connect the victims with their families, and a link to a Telegram channel — where photographs and identification cards of the victims are posted — is provided.
However, clicking on the link to the Telegram channel redirects to pictures of women allegedly looking for partners.
A reverse image search of the picture showing the accident scene finds that it was taken in September 2019. The photo was published with an article by Deutsche Welle Amharic, and is captioned in part, “Friday, September 9; Two people were killed and 31 others were injured when a bus carrying A 68377 collided head-on with another Code 3 private black vehicle in Shiro Meda, Shiro Meda”.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that a picture showing a fatal road accident that happened last week in Addis Ababa and finds it to be FALSE.
