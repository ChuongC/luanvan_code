An image is being widely shared on social media with a claim that it shows a man disguised as a woman and got caught in the Shaheen Bagh protests. Let’s analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of a man disguised as woman, caught at the Shaheen Bagh protests.
Fact: The image is that of a militant who was caught by the Jammu & Kashmir Police for opening fire in a market in Pulwama in 2015. So, the image is no way related to the ongoing Shaheen Bagh protest against CAA. Hence, the claim is FALSE.
With reverse image search, the same image was found in an article of ‘Deccan Herald’ mentioning that some burqa-clad militants had opened fire at a market in Pulwama in 2015. Police had confronted them and arrested a suspected militant wearing a burqa to disguise himself as a woman. The image can also be seen in the article of ‘Greater Kashmir’ which reported this incident.
To sum it up, image from 2015 is falsely shared as – ‘Man disguised as a woman caught at the Shaheen Bagh protest’.
