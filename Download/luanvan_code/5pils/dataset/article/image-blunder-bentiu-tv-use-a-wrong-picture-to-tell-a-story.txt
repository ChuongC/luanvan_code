Online investigative outcomes have showed that renowned unregulated media house Bentiu TV used a wrong image to tell a story.
Bentiu TV on Monday via Facebook posted a wrong image to describe the recent story of inter-communal violence which occurred in Ulang County of Upper State over the weekend. 
“Prayers for Ulang. Our heartfelt condolences to the families who lose their beloved ones. Over 42 people reportedly killed in yesterday’s fight. Below picture are people displaced from their homes” reads a Facebook post by Bentiu TV – a page that has 40, 203 followers.
The screenshot of the post can be seen below.
However, when checked by 211 Check, the image was misused.
According to facts online, the image was first used on March 22, 2021 at 6:09pm CAT depicting children at Orphanage Center in the Capital Juba.
The image is credited to Prophet Peter D, as seen in the below image.
