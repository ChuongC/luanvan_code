This image on Facebook purportedly of retired Ethiopian athlete Haile Gebrselassie with Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) spokesperson Getachew Reda is ALTERED.
On the top left corner of the image is text “Kkkkk” and three emojis.
However, the results of our Google reverse image search indicated that the photo is doctored.
The original image was shared on Getachew’s verified Twitter account on 10 January 2023 and it is of the TPLF spokesperson posing for a photo with former long-distance runner Derartu Tulu.
