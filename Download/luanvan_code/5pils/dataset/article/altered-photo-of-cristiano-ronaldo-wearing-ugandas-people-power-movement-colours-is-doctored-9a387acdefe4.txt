A photo posted to Facebook showing footballer Cristiano Ronaldo wearing a beret branded with a People Power Movement badge has been ALTERED.
In the photo, the footballer wears the uniform beret of the movement and a red shirt. The message above the image claims that he has joined the People Power Movement, a resistance group in Uganda led by Robert Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine, who is the MP for Kyadondo East constituency.
An internet search shows that the image is doctored. The footballer posted the original image of himself in a red shirt on his official Instagram account on October 22, 2020. In the original image, Mr Ronaldo is seen seated, but without the beret, and with the caption, “Thursday Style”.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo posted on Facebook showing footballer Cristiano Ronaldo wearing a beret branded with the badge of the People Power Movement and finds that it has been ALTERED.
