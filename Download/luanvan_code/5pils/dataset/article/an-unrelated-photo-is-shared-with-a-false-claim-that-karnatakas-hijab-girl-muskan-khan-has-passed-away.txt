A post is being shared widely on social media with a claim that Muskan Khan, the girl who was at the center of the Hijab controversy in Karnataka, passed away. A photo of a girl being carried by people is being shared along with the claim. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Karnataka’s hijab girl Muskan Khan has passed away. The photo shows her dead body.
Fact: The posted visual of an injured girl is an old one. The same photo was published by ‘Rediff.com’ in 2017. Also, no reputed news agency has reported about the death of Muskan Khan. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the posted visual was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found to be published by some news agencies in 2017. The ‘Rediff.com’ website has uploaded the same photo is their article – “PHOTOS: Students clash with security forces in Kashmir”, which was published in 2017.
If Muskan Khan had indeed passed away, most media outlets would have reported about it. But none of the reputed news agency has reported about the death of Muskan Khan. ‘Jamuna TV’, a Bangladesh news agency, has posted a video on its YouTube channel saying that the viral claim is just a rumour.
Also, her family has informed ‘Boom Live’ that Muskan Khan is fine.
To sum it up, an unrelated photo is shared with a false claim that Karnataka’s hijab girl Muskan Khan has passed away.
