A tweet with an image claiming to show a road in Kenya is FALSE.
The image is of a wavy-shaped road with multiple lanes, next to buildings lining up into the horizon. “Kapsabet, Nandi County. Kenya,” the tweet accompanying the image reads.
However, the writing on the buildings appears to be in one of the Asian languages, raising suspicions that the location may not be in Kenya.
A reverse image search brings up the picture published by Getty Images on 7 September 2017. According to the caption, the road is in southwest China’s Chongqing Municipality.
“There are 4-storey commercial buildings along the road. The wave-shaped design of the road is convenient for the merchants on each floor to drive the car to the door,” the caption continues.
PesaCheck has examined the tweet with an image claiming to be of a road in Kenya and finds it to be FALSE.
