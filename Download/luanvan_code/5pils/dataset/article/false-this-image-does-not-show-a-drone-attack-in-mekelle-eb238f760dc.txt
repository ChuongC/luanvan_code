This Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack in Mekelle, Tigray region, is FALSE.
The post, in Amharic, translates as; “Mekelle is overwhelmed with sadness!! In today’s drone attack in Mekele, a key person of TPLF was sent to hell. Because of this, massive shock, sadness, and anxiety have been created among the leaders of the TPLF. The next ones are waiting for their turn.”
Other social media users also posted similar posts with the same image as seen here and here.
However, Google reverse image search results showed the image is unrelated to the drone attack in Mekelle.
The image was taken from this video that was uploaded on YouTube on 3 March 2008. The headline of the video reads: “Netherlands Apache strike in Afghanistan.” The image appears on the video from minute 0:46.
On 14 September 2022, Tigrai Television reported that a federal government of Ethiopia drone strike killed 10 people in Mekelle. The attack targeted Mekelle University and Dimitsi Woyane TV station.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack in Mekelle, Tigray region, and finds it to be FALSE.
