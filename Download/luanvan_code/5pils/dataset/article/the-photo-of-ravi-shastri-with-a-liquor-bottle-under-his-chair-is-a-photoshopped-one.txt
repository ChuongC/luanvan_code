On Facebook, a photo of Ravi Shastri with Indian Cricketers that purportedly shows a liquor bottle under his chair is being shared widely. Let’s try to check the authenticity of the image put in the post.
Claim: Ravi Shastri is seen with a liquor bottle under the chair in the Indian team picture.
Fact: In the original photo, no liquor bottle is present under the chair of Ravi Shastri. The image posted is a photoshopped one. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.

When the image in the tweet is subjected to Google Reverse Image Search technique, it was found in the Twitter account of BCCI. On July 6, 2019 BCCI tweeted this image on its official Twitter account with the text “One Team. One Nation. One Emotion”. There is no liquor bottle present under the chair of Ravi Shastri in that photo.
