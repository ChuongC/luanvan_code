A couple of photos are being shared on social media with a claim that they show the Chinese soldiers killed in the Galwan clash with India, which happened in 2020. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photos of Chinese soldiers killed in the 2020 Galwan clash with India.
Fact: The posted pictures are not related to the 2020 Galwan clash. They are related to a 2010 fire accident in China. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photos were run through Google Reverse Image Search, one of the posted photos was found in an article published in 2010. The other photo in the post also has similar surroundings as seen in the photos from the 2010 article. The photos show the bodies of the people killed in a grassland fire in China. 
Multiple news reports regarding the 2010 incident can be read here, here, and here. In the ‘South China Morning Post’ article, it can be read that “of the fatalities, 15 were soldiers, two were workers with the grassland administration while five others were local residents…”
To sum it up, the posted pictures of dead Chinese soldiers are not related to the 2020 Galwan clash.
