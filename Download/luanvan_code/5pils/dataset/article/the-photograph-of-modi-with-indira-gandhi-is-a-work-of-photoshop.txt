A Facebook post with the photograph of Indira Gandhi with Kannada hero Raj Kumar was being shared widely. In the post, it is alleged that Modi was also present in the photo along with Indira Gandhi. Let’s try to analyze the claims made in the post.
Claim: Modi was present in the photograph of Indira Gandhi.
Fact: The original photo was clicked when Indira Gandhi met Kannada hero Raj Kumar at an event organized by Sangeetha Music. This photo was edited to replace some unknown person’s face with that of Modi’s. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search technique, it was found in an article of ‘The Quint’ with the title “Karnataka’s Reluctant Politician: The Life and Times of Annavaru”. From the information available in the article, it was found that the original photo was taken when Indira Gandhi met actor Raj Kumar at a Sangeetha Music event. This photo is edited by replacing some unknown person’s face in it with that of Modi’s, to mislead people. 
To conclude, the photo of Modi seen along with Indira Gandhi and Raj Kumar is a work of Photoshop.
