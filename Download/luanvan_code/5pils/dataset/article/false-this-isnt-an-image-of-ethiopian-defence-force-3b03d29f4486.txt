This Facebook post with an image purporting to show the Ethiopian Defence Force controlling strategic locations after an air raid is FALSE.
The post in Amharic reads: “The heroic Ethiopian Defence Force has taken control of an important strategic position with an air attack. The critical strategic military conquest of lands is being carried forward with spectacular victories. There is no force that can stop the heroic Ethiopian army from victory.”
Fighting resumed between government forces and Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) troops in northern Ethiopia on 24 August 2022, shattering a five-month truce.
Ethiopia’s Air Force said it had shot down a plane with weapons for the TPLF that had encroached on the country’s airspace via Sudan.
However, Yandex reverse image search results show that the picture in the claim is unrelated to the conflict in Ethiopia.
The image was posted on the Havok Journal website on 27 April 2022, in an article headlined: “They Just Move a Little Different: The Brotherhood That Shaped Me into the Woman I Am.”
The Finans Gundem news website also published the photo in an article related to the U.S.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian Defence Force taking control of an important strategic location with an air raid and finds it to be FALSE.
