These images, shared on Facebook, with a claim that they show the Ethiopian Air Force destroying 27 trucks belonging to Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) force is FALSE.
The post claims the trucks were being driven from Bati town to Mille front.
“Breaking news: The Ethiopia air force destroyed 27 trucks belonging to the TPLF force traveling from Bati town to Mille front,” the post in the Amharic language reads.
Bati is in the Amhara region, and Mille is a town in the Afar region.
However, Google reverse image search reveals that the pictures have been published on different platforms.
On 18 July 2009, the Diplomat website published the first image in an article about India’s Air Force interest in 36 more Rafale Fighter jets from France, By Rafale- RIAT.
The second image was published on July 14 2021, by the CBC news website in an article, “ Growing number of B.C. residents ordered to leave their homes as wildfires rage.” The photo is credited to ‘Brenda Creek fire (Contributed/B.C Wildfire Service)’.
There are reports that Ethiopia’s military carried out an airstrike on the capital of the war-torn Tigray region that a hospital official and TPLF said killed six people and injured 21 others. The government said the latest strike in a campaign of air bombardments hit a factory in Mekelle used by the TPLF.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force destroying TPLF force 27 trucks that were being driven from from Bati town to Mille front and finds it to be FALSE.
