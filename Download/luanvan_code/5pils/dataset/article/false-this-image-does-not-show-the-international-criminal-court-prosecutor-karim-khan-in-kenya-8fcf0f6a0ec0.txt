A Facebook post claiming International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan is in Kenya, is FALSE.
The post reads: “ICC prosecutor Karim Khan is currently in Kenya . Bondo is real”. It is accompanied by an image showing Karim and Kenyan President William Ruto.
Khan was elected the ICC prosecutor on 12 February 2021. The British lawyer represented Ruto in 2013 when the president faced charges of crimes against humanity relating to the 2007/2008 post-election violence in The Hague, Netherlands. The case was dismissed in April 2016, due to insufficient evidence.
A reverse search on TinEye, however, reveals that the image in the claim dates back to 2013.
The photo, captured on 4 October 2013, was shared by Nation Africa alongside other images of Ruto’s appearance at the ICC in the Netherlands.
There is no evidence from a credible source that Khan was in Kenya on 28 August 2022, when the claim in question was made.
The ICC prosecutor had, however, visited Sudan and on 29 August 2022 issued a statement, saying he was back at The Hague after completion of his visit to Khartoum and Darfur.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly showing ICC prosecutor Karim Khan in Kenya with President William Ruto and finds it to be FALSE.
