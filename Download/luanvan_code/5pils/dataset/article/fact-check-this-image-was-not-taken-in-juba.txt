A viral picture claiming to have been taken in Juba, South Sudan, of someone sleeping outside under a mosquito net due to an alleged earthquake was taken in Uganda in June 2022.

A viral picture was posted on social media claiming to have been taken in Juba, but this is unproven. Among these pages that shared the claim are Aweil TV and a Facebook user name Sir Yol Isaac. Together the posts garnered over 80 reactions.
The post, which the owner posted at the end, was posted when a rumour was making rounds alleging the purported occurrence of an earthquake in  Juba, the capital city of South Sudan and other parts of the country.
The photo appears to show someone sleeping outside under a mosquito net after people were told not to sleep inside their houses to avoid fatalities—a rumour debunked by 211 Check.

A reverse image search by 211 Check on the image shows that it was once used by Juba, South Sudan, in September 2022. It partly reads, “..This life has no balance, with images of tears of South Sudanese citizens.”
It appears to have been first posted on June 19, 2022, by Muvistar SaveLife Youth Foundation Uganda, a community-based nonprofit, with the caption, “I was amazed seeing this boy trying to save his life from Malaria by setting up a Mosquito net. Street Children’s influence increases every day in the urban cities of Uganda.”
It was also shared on Twitter here on October 23, 2022.
Conclusion:
The viral image claiming to show someone sleeping outside under a mosquito net in Juba, South Sudan, due to an alleged earthquake, is false and originated in Uganda in June 2022, according to a reverse image search by 211 Check.
