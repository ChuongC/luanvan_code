This post claiming to show an image of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) troops in North Wollo is FALSE.
The image, shared on Facebook, has an Amharic text that translates, “Breaking Information: It is reported that TPLF has been instigating conflict in North Wollo bordering areas. The invading force is said to be operating 60 kilometres away from Lalibela. The group has been firing heavy artillery against farmers, it was learnt. According to local sources, they are undertaking exercises on a mountain called Jamedo. The trend demands attention.”
The TPLF and Ethiopia defence forces have been fighting since November 2020. However, Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on 14 June 2022, said his administration is committed to peace negotiations with TPLF, forming a committee for the same.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image claiming to show TPLF forces in North Wollo in June 2022 is false.
The Walta website published the image on 11 May 2022, in an article in Amharic that partly translates into, “the fighting exercises enhanced capacity of the army, it was learnt”. The caption reads, “fighting exercises” and the image is credited to the FDRE Defence Force.
This image was also published on the official Facebook account of the Ethiopian Defence Forces on 11 May 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces in North Wollo and finds it to be FALSE.
