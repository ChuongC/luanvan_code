A Facebook post with an image purporting to show two posters advertising the grand opening of the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party offices in the United States plastered on tall buildings is ALTERED.
UDA is a Kenyan registered political party. Deputy President William Ruto, who has served in the position since 2013, under the Jubilee Party, announced that he will be running for president on the UDA ticket in the 2022 presidential elections.
The announcement follows strained relations between Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta that saw the Jubilee party’s National Management Committee (NMC) resolve to oust the DP. However, the resolution is yet to be ratified by the party’s National Executive Council (NEC).
As such, the post in question claims that the image shows two posters advertising the grand opening of the UDA offices in the USA.
However, a Google reverse search of the image reveals that the photo is doctored, with the original being an artistic impression of a building billboard mock-up posted by Zee Que, a Turkish designer on Dribbble.com, a website that pools designs from all over the world, on April 23, 2017.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show two posters advertising the grand opening of the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) offices in the United States plastered on tall buildings and finds it to be ALTERED.
