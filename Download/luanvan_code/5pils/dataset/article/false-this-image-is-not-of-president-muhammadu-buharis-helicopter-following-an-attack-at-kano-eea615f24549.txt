This Facebook post purportedly showing Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s damaged helicopter windshield following an attack at Kano is FALSE.
“President Buhari’s Helicopter was attacked While Landing in Kano earlier today. The Windshield Was Broken. This is bad and condemnable,” the post reads.
Buhari visited Kano on 30 January 2023, commissioning projects which state Governor Umar Ganduje executed. During the visit, People’s Democratic Party (PDP) national spokesperson Debo Ologunagba, however, alleged that some miscreants sponsored by the All Progressive Congress (APC) party, attacked Buhari’s entourage. APC has since denounced claims of the alleged attack.
A Google reverse search for the image in question shows that the helicopter belongs to Kenya’s former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.
An 1 April 2022 article in The Standard with the headline, “14 arrested in connection with Raila chopper stoning in Soy”, featured the image in the claim.
The images of the Kenyan politician’s helicopter were originally shared on Twitter by Suna East Member of Parliament Junet Mohammed.
The tweet reads: “Today we almost got killed in soy constituency Uasin Gishu County at the Burial of Mzee Jackson Kibor’s burial. Our chopper was completly (sic) destroyed and we had to look for alternative means mid air… Congratulations Hon caleb Kositany. @WilliamsRuto is happy now.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post purportedly showing Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s damaged helicopter windshield after an attack in Kano and finds it to be FALSE.
