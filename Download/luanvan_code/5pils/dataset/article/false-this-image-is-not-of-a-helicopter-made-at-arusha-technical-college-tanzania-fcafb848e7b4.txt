A Facebook post with an image purportedly of a helicopter made by students of Arusha Technical College (ATC), Tanzania, is FALSE.
The post reads: “Picture of helicopter made by students of Arusha Technical College, Tanzania.”
In 2016, ATC’s mechanical engineering department was reportedly in the final stages of building a two-seater helicopter. The project seeks to make affordable choppers and ease Tanzania’s transport challenges.
However, the helicopter in the claim is not the one from the ATC project.
A Google reverse image search traces an article by OneIndia dated 28 December 2015 featuring the image.
The headline reads: “PM Modi to lay foundation stone for HAL’s chopper facility in Tumakuru”.
Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is an Indian state-owned aerospace and defence company headquartered in Bangalore, India.
The original image shared by OneIndia has the HAL logo, which is missing in the claim.
The ATC flagged the claim as fake news in a post dated 4 October 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly showing a helicopter made by students of Arusha Technical College and finds it to be FALSE.
