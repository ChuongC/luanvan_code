An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Russian military jets downed by Ukraine is FALSE.
The photo was shared on 24 February 2022, with an Amharic text that translates, “Ukraine has shot down five Russian warplanes that violated its territory”.
The claim comes amidst reports of fighting between Ukraine and Russia that started on 24 February 2022. The war has been described as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Countries and international bodies, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, United Nations, and European Union, have condemned the invasion, and various sanctions have been slapped against Russia.
It was also reported that Ukraine downed a Russian military helicopter and five planes on 24 February 2022.
However, the image claiming to show Ukraine shooting down five Russian planes in claim we are fact-checking is false.
Reverse image search results on Yandex reveal that the image is of Ukrainian National Defence conducting a test cruise missile facility and defence system in 2018.
The image was taken during the test around Odessa, Ukraine and is credited to the Ukraine National Security Council on 5 December 2018. The image was also featured here and here.
PesaCheck has investigated an image shared on Facebook claiming to show Ukraine shooting down five planes of Russia and finds it to be FALSE.
