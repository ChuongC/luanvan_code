A tweet claiming to show a pack of lions at a container depot in Nairobi is FALSE.
The tweet from February 13 states that lions from the Nairobi National Park had been spotted at the Kenya Ports Authorityâ€™s Internal Container Depot, located at Embakasi in Nairobi.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the photo was taken in India. Reports published by 25 Hour News and The Times of India indicate that the pride of four lions was spotted on February 11 at Port Pipavav located in Gujarat.
According to the article in The Times of India, lions have interfered with operations at the port a number of times, and on February 4, a 5-year-old boy from Uchhaiya village which is near the port was attacked when he tried to play with lion cubs.
The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has urged Kenyans to disregard claims that the photo was taken at the Nairobi depot, which is also located near the Nairobi National Park.
KWS identified also that the post was first circulated on social media on 12 February by one Dhanraj Nathwani from India, who stated that the photos were taken at Port Pipavav.
The Kenya Ports Authority also tweeted that the photos are not from Kenya, stating that the depot on the photo is not one of their facilities.
In 2016, lions from the Nairobi National Park left the park, and attacked an elderly man along Mombasa Road. KWS eventually managed to capture the stray lions and returned them to the park.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that stray lions have been spotted at a KPA depot in Nairobi and finds this to be FALSE.
