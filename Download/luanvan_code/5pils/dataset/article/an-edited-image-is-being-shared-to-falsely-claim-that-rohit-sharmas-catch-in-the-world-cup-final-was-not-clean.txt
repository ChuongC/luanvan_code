A screengrab of the 2023 Mens Cricket World Cup final where Australian cricketer Travis Head takes Rohit Sharma’s catch is being shared on social media. This visual shows the ball touching the ground. It is being claimed that the catch was not clean. Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.
Claim: Rohit Sharma’s catch by Travis Head in the 2023 World Cup final was not clean.
Fact: The original footage confirms that the catch was clean, and the ball did not touch the ground. The viral photo is manipulated. Therefore, the claim in the post is False.
To verify the viral claim, we closely examined the catch of Rohit Sharma taken by Travis Head in the replay of the Cricket World Cup final available on Disney+ Hotstar. This revealed that Travis Head did not drop the catch, contradicting the assertion in the viral post.
Additionally, the International Cricket Council (ICC) posted the video of the catch on Instagram, providing another angle to scrutinise. In both the Hotstar footage and the ICC video, it is evident that the catch was clean, and at no point did the ball touch the ground.

This makes it clear that the viral photo was edited to make it look like Travis Head took an unclean catch, where the ball was touching the ground.
To sum up, the claim that Rohit Sharma’s catch by Travis Head in the World Cup final was not a clean catch is untrue. The viral photo in circulation is morphed.
