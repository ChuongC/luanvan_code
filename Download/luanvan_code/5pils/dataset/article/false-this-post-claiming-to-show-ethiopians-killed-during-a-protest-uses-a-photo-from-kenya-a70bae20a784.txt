A Facebook post containing an image claiming to show civilians killed during protests that followed the assassination of Ethiopian singer Hachalu Hundessa is FALSE.
The post claims that the attached picture shows victims of violence against civilians which followed propaganda from Oromo government officials, such as regional president Shimels Abdissa, Addis Ababa Mayor Takele Umma and opposition leaders Bekele Gerba and Jawar Mohamed.
The post also claims that people were specifically targeted after their ethnicity was determined using their identification papers, and attributes the action to ‘Qerro’, a movement of Oromo youth agitating for increased political freedom.
The picture in question that is used in the post shows two bodies on the ground and a burning motorcycle on top of them.
Ethiopian Singer Hachalu Hundessa was shot dead in the Gelan area on the outskirts of Addis Ababa on June 29, 2020.
The death of the singer was followed by attacks on civilians and minorities in Addis Ababa for three days and in the Oromia region of Ethiopia for more than a week, leading to the loss of more than 200 lives, and an internet shutdown that lasted for three weeks. Additionally, a number of media houses were out of service for a number of days, and a number of opposition leaders and thousands of protestors were arrested.
However, the image in question is not from Ethiopia, and a reverse image search shows that it was posted on Twitter in May 2020, a month before the unrest in Ethiopia, alongside a post about an incident of mob justice against phone thieves in Kenya.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that one of the pictures used in the post shows civilians killed after Ethiopian singer Hachalu Hundessa was assassinated and finds it to be FALSE.
