This Facebook post with an image of a crater on a landscaped hill surrounded by settlements, supposedly in Longisa, Bomet County, Kenya, is FALSE.
A watermark is visible at the bottom right corner of the image.
The text accompanying the image reads: “Longisa in Bomet to the World. Small heaven on earth (sic)”.
Bomet is a county in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. The area receives abundant rainfall throughout the year.
Some contrasting comments on the post raise doubts on whether the photo truly captures the region’s essence, prompting PesaCheck to investigate.
A reverse search of the image on Google shows multiple results indicating that the region is in Uganda, not Bomet. This tweet, accompanied by the image under scrutiny, includes a statement from the author identifying the location as Kisoro and attributing the photo to Ugandan photographer Derrick Ssenyonyi. The hill is identified as ‘Sagitwe’ in the replies.
A subsequent search on the photographer’s Twitter account brings up the image shared with three others, labelled as being from Kisoro.
A Yandex search also shows that the area is in Uganda. And here a photo of a similar landscape states that the image is an “Aerial view of #volcanos near Bwindi, cultivated by locals to grow crops. #Uganda.”
A keyword search brings up a stock video by Getty Images, showing that the region in the photo is indeed in Uganda.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image supposedly of Longisa in Bomet County, Kenya, and found it to be FALSE.
