This Facebook post with images purportedly of aliens in Nature’s Valley, South Africa is FALSE.
The post reads: “Alіenѕ” with umbilical cords still attached have been found in the area of Natre’s Valley, which is located in South Africa, and they are generating a ѕtіг.”
Aliens are extraterrestrial beings featured mostly in fictional films.
A reverse image search on Yandex established that the first image dates back to 2013 and is of a mummified baboon found in South Africa.
Three images in the claim were featured in a 12 July 2013 Independent article titled, “Alien corpse turns out to be a female mummified baboon”. The mummified baboons found outside Nature’s Valley sparked an internet frenzy, with claims of being evidence of extraterrestrial life.

South African news outlets also reported on the alien-like creature, adding that Dr Magdalena Braum of The Crags Veterinary Clinic performed an autopsy confirming it was a newborn female baboon.
A reverse search of the fourth image on Yandex established that it is of Swiss painter and sculptor Alberto Giacometti’s Walking Man I 1960 bronze sculpture.
