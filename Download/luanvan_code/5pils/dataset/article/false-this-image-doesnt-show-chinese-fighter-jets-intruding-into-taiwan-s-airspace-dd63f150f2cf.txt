A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Chinese fighter jets intruding into Taiwan’s airspace is FALSE.
The post in Amharic shared on 2 August 2022 translates as: “Chinese fighter jets intrude and entered Taiwan’s airspace. CGTN reported that Chinese Su 35 jets have entered by violating Taiwan’s airspace.”
News reports in August 2022 show tension between Taiwan and China. The Chinese army has been accused of simulating an attack on Taiwan’s main island, after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo in the claim does not show a Chinese fighter jet entering Taiwan airspace.
Search results show that the National Interest news website published the photo in an article titled; “Russia Is Talking Up Its Su-35 Fighter, But Just How Good Is It?” on 25 October 2020.
The image was also posted on the Defence Aviation post website on 15 January 2022, in an article with the heading; “Su-35E “Super Flanker”, could the deadly S400 missiles be Russia’s “New Year’s gift” to Iran amid growing threats from Israel?” This image was published on different websites before August 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show Chinese fighter jets intruding into Taiwan’s airspace and finds it to be FALSE.
