This Facebook post with a photo supposedly of a skyscraper in Siaya County, western Kenya, is MISSING CONTEXT.
The image depicts a building dubbed ‘Siaya Park’ and has the description: “Siaya is the most developed county in Nyanza after Kisumu.”
But is the building located in Siaya County?
A reverse image search on Google, TinEye, and Bing did not yield positive results for the photo. However, a keyword search confirmed that although the building is named Siaya Park, it is not in Siaya.
An article by GNA real estate company indicated that Siaya Park is on Oloitoktok Road in Kileleshwa, Nairobi.
The company published an image of the building from a different angle, but the name ‘Siaya Park’ is visible with similar colour schemes.
Siaya Park Apartment and Kenya Property Centre also published photos of the building.
We searched for Siaya Park on Google Maps and confirmed that it is in Kileleshwa. The image uploaded on Google Maps is similar to the one we are debunking.
PesaCheck examined a Facebook post with an image supposedly of a skyscraper in Siaya town, and found it to be MISSING CONTEXT.
