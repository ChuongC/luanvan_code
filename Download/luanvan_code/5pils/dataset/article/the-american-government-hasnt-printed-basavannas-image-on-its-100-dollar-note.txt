A post is being widely shared on social media claiming that the American government has printed the image of Basavanna, one of the greatest spiritual leaders of India, on the country’s $100 note. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: American government has printed the image of Basavanna on USD 100 note.
Fact: The $ 100 note carries the image of Benjamin Franklin. The American government has never printed any other person’s image on its 100-dollar currency note. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When we searched about the details of various currency notes published in America, the Currency Education Program’s website uscurrency.gov was found in the search results. As per the information available on the website, the design of the American dollar has changed 4 times but all of them carried the image of Benjamin Franklin. So, the American government has never printed Basavanna’s image on its currency note.
There are few websites that allow replacing the image on the $ 100 note with an image of our choice. You can notice that one such $100 note, with the Obama picture on it, has the same code as the one shared in the post. So, the $100 note with Basavanna image could have also been created in a similar manner.
FACTLY had earlier debunked similar news about the American government printing image of Ambedkar and Chhatrapati Shivaji on their country’s $100 note. These articles can be read here and here.
To sum it up, the American government hasn’t printed Basavanna’s image on its 100 dollar note.
