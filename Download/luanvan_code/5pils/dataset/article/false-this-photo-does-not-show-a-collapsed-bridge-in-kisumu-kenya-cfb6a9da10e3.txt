An image shared on Facebook claiming to show a collapsed bridge in Kisumu, Kenya is FALSE.
The photo shows a bridge that has caved in under the weight of a lorry carrying what appears to be ballast from a construction site. In the background of the photo, a crowd of onlookers is seen milling around the edge of the bridge.
The post accompanying the image suggests that the bridge collapsed despite costing KSh 15 million to construct.
The post does not mention the name of the bridge or where in Kisumu it is located. Neither does it record any details of the incident nor whether any injuries were reported during the accident.
However, a reverse image search brings up the same photo published alongside an article dated March 2, 2021, by a Ghanian-based online publication called Modern Ghana.
The article identifies the bridge as the Wassa Akropong, located in the Wassa Amenfi East Constituency of Western Region in Ghana. The article says that a 27-year-old motorist was killed in the accident in which two other people were injured.
A search engine query of the name of the bridge brings up a number of articles with the image and story corroborating the evidence that the bridge is located in Ghana.
One of the articles is by Ghanaweb.com, which also includes a video showing the incident. The article further explains that the truck was transporting stones to a site along Cocoa Road, which is under construction.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook photo claiming to show a collapsed bridge in Kisumu, Kenya, and finds it to be FALSE.
