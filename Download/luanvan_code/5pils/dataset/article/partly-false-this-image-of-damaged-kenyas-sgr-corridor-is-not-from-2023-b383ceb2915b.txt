This post shared on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show a damaged Kenya’s Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) corridor is PARTLY FALSE.
The post reads: “Kenya Railways announces closure of a section of the SGR corridor between Mombasa Terminus and Mariakani, which has experienced a landslide due to the ongoing heavy rains.”
The claim has been shared here and here.
On 18 November 2023, Kenya Railways announced changes in SGR operations due to ongoing heavy rains. According to the statement, a section of the SGR corridor between Mombasa Terminus and Mariakani was closed after experiencing a landslide. The national railway did not share images of the terminus.
A Google search for the keywords “SGR railway collapse due to floods Kenya” established that the image used in the claim is old. It was from a section of the railway in Makueni County.
The image was featured in an article dated 21 November 2016 with the headline, “Heavy floods sweep away parts of the Multi Billion Standard Gauge Railway (SGR).”
According to the article, “A section of the SGR protection slope, around Kambu area in Makueni County, was swept away by heavy rains which has pounding parts of Ukambani and all over the country…”
The incident was also covered by Kenyan local media outlets.
PesaCheck has looked into a post shared on X (formerly Twitter) with an image purportedly of a section of Kenya’s Standard Gauge Railway corridor between Mombasa Terminus and Mariakani that was damaged by ongoing heavy rain and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
