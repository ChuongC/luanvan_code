A photo shared on Facebook with text claiming Kenyan presidential hopeful Raila Odinga collapsed at his Karen home due to exhaustion is MISLEADING.
The post, dated 24 June 2022 reads; “There are reports that at around 6.30 pm this evening, Azimio La Umoja Presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga collapsed at his Karen residence due to exhaustion. Jakom, we need you strong and healthy so that you can concede healthily on 10th August. Wishing you more years.”
A similar claim was made here.
Odinga was cleared to run for president by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) on the Azimio la Umoja coalition ticket on 5 June 2022.
Alongside his running mate, Martha Karua, Odinga has been on a campaign trail wooing voters ahead of the 9 August 2022 polls.
A Google reverse image search shows the photo in question was first shared in 2017. Major local news outlets used the photo in the claim to report that Odinga had been hospitalised after addressing rallies in Kilifi. At the time, he was running for president on a National Super Alliance (NASA) ticket.
The then NASA coalition spokesman, Dennis Onyango, confirmed Odinga’s hospitalisation in a Facebook post, saying it was a suspected case of food poisoning.
There have been no official reports of Odinga collapsing at his Karen residence on the Azimio coalition’s official channels of communication or credible mainstream media.
PesaCheck looked into a photo shared on Facebook with a text claiming Raila Odinga collapsed at his Karen home due to exhaustion and found it to be MISLEADING.
