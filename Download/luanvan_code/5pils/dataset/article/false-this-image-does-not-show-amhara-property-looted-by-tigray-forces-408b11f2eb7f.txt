A post shared on Facebook purporting to show property looted by Tigray forces from Amhara regional state is FALSE.
An image showing different property loaded onto a pick-up car is part of the post.
“The Tigray people have looted Amharas in this manner”, the post in Amharic reads, referring to the image.
“ I said Tigray people were looting because they were collaborating and participating; and Amhara people were robbed”, the post adds.
Google reverse image search results show that the image was taken in Mozambique and has been available online since 2017.
It shows an overloaded pick-up vehicle on the side of the road to South africa’s Kosi Bay border with Mozambique. The photo first appeared on SAPeople.com, an online news outlet. The image has been used in social media posts at different times, as seen here and here.
In the doctored photo, an Ethiopian vehicle number plate matching those of the Tigray region was added to the original image to create the claim.
On 8 December 2021, the United Nations announced that it had suspended food aid distribution in Dessie and Kombolcha due to “the mass looting of warehouses across Kombolcha in recent days, reportedly by elements of the Tigrayan forces and some members of the local population”.
Tigray forces denied the looting accusations.
Despite reports of looting in Amhara, the photo used to advance the claim is false.
PesaCheck has investigated an image shared on Facebook claiming to show properties looted by Tigray forces from Amhara region and finds it to be FALSE.
