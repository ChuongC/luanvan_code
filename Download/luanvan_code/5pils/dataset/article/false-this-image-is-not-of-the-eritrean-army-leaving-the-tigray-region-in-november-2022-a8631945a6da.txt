This tweet claiming to show an image of the Eritrean army leaving the Tigray region in November 2022 is FALSE.
The image was shared on Twitter with a text in Amharic that translates to; “Breaking news! According to the information received, the Eritrean army has wholly left the Tigray region.”
On 27 November 2022, Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) spokesperson Getachew Reda tweeted: “Eritrean forces are still on a rampage, killing children and women at will, ransacking, destroying and looting property at will.”
However, Google reverse image search results established that the photo used to support the claim is not related to Eritrean soldiers leaving the Tigray region in November 2022.
The Guardian news website published the image on 19 August 2015 in an article headlined, “Divided and dispersed, Eritrea opposition struggles to harness spirit of resistance.”
The image’s caption explains, “Eritrean soldiers returning from the Adi-Quala front lines in May 2000.” The photo is credited to Steve Forrest/EPA.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image purportedly of the Eritrean army leaving the Tigray region in November 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
