A Facebook post with an image claiming to show heavy military equipment deployed by Russia along the Finnish border is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates, “Breaking: After Finland and Sweden thought of joining NATO, Russia deployed heavy military equipment along the Finnish border.”
Recent reports indicate that Sweden and Finland have declared interest in joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Russia warned a nuclear-free Baltic region would no longer be possible if Finland and Sweden become NATO members, alluding to additional nuclear deployments in Europe.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo in the claim does not show Russian troops on the border of Finland.
Search results show that the UAWire news website published the photo in an article, “Russia deploys troops and tanks to Afghanistan border” on 20 July 2021.
The image was also posted on the Disclosure.Ninja website on 6 October 2016, in an article, “40 million Russians prepare for disaster or war right now.” This image was published on different websites before 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show heavy military equipment deployed by Russia along the Finnish border and finds it to be FALSE.
