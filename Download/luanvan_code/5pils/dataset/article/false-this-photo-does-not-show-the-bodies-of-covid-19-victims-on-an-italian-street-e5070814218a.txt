An image shared on Facebook claiming to show the bodies of COVID-19 victims on an Italian street is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by a post warning Kenyans to stay at home and slow down the rate of Covid-19 infections.
Italy has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths at 6,077 as at 24 March, having surpassed China where the pandemic originated.
A reverse image search of the photograph is of people in Frankfurt Germany lying on the ground in remembrance of the 528 victims of the Katzbach Nazi concentration camp. The photo shows people participating in an art project in 2014 to remember the victims of the Nazi’s Katzbac concentration camp in Frankfurt.
A Google search shows that this original photo was originally published by Reuters on March 24, 2014.
The caption on the Reuters photo partly reads: “The inmates of the Katzbach concentration camp, a part of the former Adler industrial factory, were forced into a death march to the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Dachau on March 24, 1945. Some 528 victims of Katzbach are buried at Frankfurt’s central cemetery.”
Data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre indicates that there are 382,644 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 16,586 deaths as of 23 March.
The viral respiratory infection was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December 2019.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo claiming to show photos of the bodies of COVID-19 victims on an Italian street and finds it to be FALSE.
