A post is being shared that claims that a new bus route number 420 from Vidhana Soudha to Parappana Agrahara (central jail) is planned by the Congress government for the first time in Bengaluru. Letâ€™s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: New bus with Route Number 420 from Vidhana Soudha to Parappana Agrahara (Central Jail) is launched by the Congress government in Bengaluru.
Fact: The image is morphed. There is no bus with route number 420 allotted by Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC). The original image shows route number 365 instead. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.
On reverse image search of the image, a bus with the same number plate is found on several websites and blog posts (here, here, and here).
Comparing the original image with the viral image we found that the viral image is digitally edited.
Subsequent search on the Bengaluru bus route numbers, we found that there is no bus with route number 420. Besides, to travel from Vidhana Soudha to the central jail, one has to take two routes and there is no direct bus route available. Further, by translating the route name written on the bus into English and verifying it with the bus number on the website, we found that bus route number 365 runs between Kempegowda bus station to Bannerghatta National Park.
To sum up, a digitally edited image is shared as a new bus with Route No. 420 is launched by the Karnataka government in Bengaluru.
