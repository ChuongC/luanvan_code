This Facebook post with a photo supposedly of Homa Bay County’s new governor’s park in Kenya is FALSE.
“The current state of the Homabay governor’s Park, just opposite KCB bank. Ng’ama nong’eyo yawaaa. Wang’ni lich (Who knew? This time it is crazy) Thank you H.E Governor Gladys Wanga for giving us a reason to smile again,” the post reads.
Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga launched a governor’s park on 30 June 2023, alongside a stadium and other infrastructure projects.
But is the photo of the park launched in Homa Bay?
We performed a Google reverse image search on the photo and established that it is of RH Rooftop Restaurant in New York, USA.
The picture depicts garden rooms on the restaurant’s rooftop. The rooms are inspired by European gardens and feature Japanese boxwood hedges and London plane trees, among others.
A video shared by Governor Wanga showcasing the park confirmed that it is structurally different from the image we are debunking.
PesaCheck examined a Facebook post with a photo supposedly of Homa Bay County new governor’s park and found it to be FALSE.
