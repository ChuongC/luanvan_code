A post with the image of a woman driving a tractor filled with women is being widely shared across social media platforms with a claim that these women are rallying in solidarity with the protesting farmers. Through this article let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Rajasthan women rallied in solidarity with farmers’ protest.
Fact: The image actually shows Jat women protesters agitating for reservation in Rohtak, Haryana back in 2017. This image has nothing to do with the ongoing farmers’ protest. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Reverse image search of the photo in the post led us to a 2017 news article which carried the same image. According to the article, the image shows Jat women protesters agitating for reservation in Rohtak, Haryana.
Further, the same image was also featured in a listicle of a news agency. Even according to this, the image is related to Jat protests seeking reservation in Haryana. With all these, we can say for sure that the image does not show Rajasthani Women rallying in solidarity with ongoing farmers’ protest.
Also, we could not find any news articles related to Rajasthani women tractor rally in solidarity with the ongoing farmer’s protest.
In the light of the ongoing farmers protest opposing the new farm laws, posts like these are being widely shared on social media platforms with misleading claims.
To sum it up, 2017 image of Jat women protesters agitating for reservation in Rohtak is shared as Rajasthani women’s rally in solidarity with the ongoing farmers’ protest.
