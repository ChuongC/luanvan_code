An image posted on Facebook claiming to show a fire outbreak in Jijiga, the capital city of the Somali region, Ethiopia, is FALSE.
The Amharic post shared on 13 August 2022, translates as; “Breaking: Jijiga 13 kebele a fire erupting killed four people and injured many others. It also damaged properties. We will follow up and report.”
A link to a Telegram channel purporting to contain further information about the claim is attached to the post.
Jijiga is the capital city of the Somali Region of Ethiopia. It became the main city of the Somali Region in 1995 after the capital was moved from Gode.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the image is not related to Jijiga.
The abc10 news website published the picture on 19 August 2020, alongside an article titled: “What the fires in Vacaville and Fairfield look like up close.”
The picture’s caption reads: “A mobile home and car burning at Spanish Flat Mobile Villa as the LNU Lightning Complex fires tear through unincorporated Napa County, Calif, on 18 August 2020. Fire crews across the region scrambled to contain dozens of wildfires sparked by lightning strikes as a statewide heat wave continues.” The image is credited to Noah Berger/AP.
Additionally, there are no news reports regarding the fire outbreak in Jijiga, Somali region of Ethiopia.
