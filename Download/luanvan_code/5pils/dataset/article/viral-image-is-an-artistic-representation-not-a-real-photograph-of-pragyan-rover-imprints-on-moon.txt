Viral image is an artistic representation, not a real photograph of Pragyan rover imprints on Moon - FACTLY

Update (25 August 2023): Today, ISRO has released footage of the Pragyan rover from Chandrayaan-3 as it rolls down from the Vikram lander, captured by the lander imager camera. The ISRO logo and National Emblem symbols can be seen embossed on the two rear wheels of the rover.
Following the successful soft landing of Chandrayaan-3’s Lander Module on the lunar surface on 23 August 2023 and the subsequent deployment of the Pragyan rover, an image that shows the State Emblem of India and ISRO’s logo positioned between tyre marks is being widely shared on social media. The claim accompanying the image suggests that these markings are the imprints from the wheels of the Pragyan lander, given that the rover’s wheels have been embossed with these symbols. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image depicting imprints on the Moon’s surface created by the wheels of the Pragyan rover, featuring the State Emblem of India and ISRO’s logo.
Fact: The viral image is purely an artwork. ISRO has not yet released images of the Pragyan rover’s wheel impressions on the lunar surface. However, the rear wheels of the Pragyan rover are embossed with the State Emblem of India and ISRO’s logo. These symbols will be imprinted on the terrain along the tyre tracks, but not in between the two tyre marks. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
As per ISRO’s official website, the Pragyan rover’s rear wheels bear two embossed symbols: one displaying the State Emblem of India, and the other showcasing ISRO’s logo. As the rover travels across the lunar surface, these symbols will be impressed upon the terrain along the tyre tracks. However, they will not appear between the two tyre marks, as shown in the viral image. This alignment can be observed in the visuals presented within the representative animation video released by ISRO.
However, at the time of writing this article, ISRO had not released any official real images depicting the imprints of the Pragyan rover on the lunar surface. Furthermore, during our internet search using the name “Krishanshu Garg” to trace the origin of the credited viral image, we came across an Instagram account under the same name. The account holder, Krishanshu Garg, provided clarity through Instagram stories that the viral image is exclusively a work of art. When contacted earlier by ‘The Quint’, he stated that he made this art using Photoshop software.
Similarly, in an earlier instance, the Chandrayaan-2 mission launched in 2019 also featured the Pragyan rover, with its wheels embossed with the same symbols as those of the recent Chandrayaan-3 mission. Likewise, NASA’s Curiosity rover had its wheels embossed with a distinctive pattern referred to as “Morse code.” This intricate arrangement comprised small, raised dots and dashes forming the Morse code representation of “JPL,” which stands for Jet Propulsion Laboratory—an entity overseeing the mission. This embossed pattern served various purposes, including visual identification, navigation, and engineering reference.
To sum it up, the viral image does not depict imprints on the Moon’s surface created by the wheels of the Pragyan rover.
