A Facebook post claiming to show a photo of Deputy President William Ruto at the Azimio La Umoja Convention at the Kasarani Stadium has been ALTERED.
“The cameras just spotted Dp Ruto in Kasarani during Raila’s meeting,” the post states.
A purported image of Ruto wearing a black suit, white shirt and green tie appearing to peep from behind a green gate is attached to the post.
On 10 December 2021, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party Leader Raila Odinga hosted an event dubbed the Azimio La Umoja Convention at Kasarani Stadium. He used the event to officially declare his 2022 presidential bid.
But is it true that Ruto was at the Azimio La Umoja Convention? We checked.
On the date of the convention, Ruto joined the congregation of the Christian Church International at Osasimwa ground in Olorropil, Narok County for a service according to his own posts on Twitter. He used the same platform to inform the public that he later went to Moi Garden Stadium in Lodwar Town in Turkana County ahead of a regional cultural festival.
We also performed a reverse image search and discovered that the original image is of Kenyan comedian, MC Jessy, whose real name is Jasper Muthomi. On 3 January 2020, MC Jessy posted the image to his Twitter account and asked his followers to suggest a caption.
The image with the claim has been doctored by replacing the comedian’s face with that of the DP.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show a photo of Deputy President William Ruto at the Azimio La Umoja Convention at Kasarani Stadium and finds it to be ALTERED.
