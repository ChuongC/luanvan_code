A YouTube video with an image claiming to show a scene from the twin bombings in Kampala is FALSE.
At least six people died in the Kampala twin suicide bomb attack that occurred on 16 November 2021 at the Central Police Station and along Parliamentary Avenue.
While police say rebel group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) was behind the attack, militant group Islamic State has claimed responsibility for both attacks.
The twin attacks that took place are in addition to three other bomb explosions that occurred in Uganda in October 2021.
The title of the video in the post is written in Luganda and reads, “Bomb in Kampala people have died including Police CPS”.
However, a Google reverse search of the image shows that it was taken in 2016 during protests following the detention of then presidential candidate, Kizza Besigye, three days before the February 18 polls.
PesaCheck has looked into a video with an image claiming to show a scene from the Kampala twin bombings and finds it to be FALSE.
