This Facebook post with an image claiming to be of a drone attacking the Oromo Liberation Army is FALSE.
“Shane, the junta emissary, was hit by a drone while they were in a meeting and graduating newly trained members,” the post in Afaan Oromo, shared on Facebook, reads.
There are reports that the Ethiopian city of Mendi in the Oromia region was bombed in November 2022. Over 30 people died and dozens others were injured in four drone strikes in civilian areas, according to the reports.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture we are fact-checking is not related to a drone attack in the Oromia region.
The Korean Times website published the image on 27 December 2021, in an article about South Korea’s intention to deploy “homegrown surveillance drones by 2031”. The description was that it is an “unmanned military drone on patrol air to air”. Credit is given to Getty Images, the stock images repository.
The image was also posted on the Westside Today website on 6 June 2014, alongside an article titled, “LAPD Chief Beck to Vet Drones Before Use.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of a drone attacking the Oromo Liberation Army and finds it to be FALSE.
