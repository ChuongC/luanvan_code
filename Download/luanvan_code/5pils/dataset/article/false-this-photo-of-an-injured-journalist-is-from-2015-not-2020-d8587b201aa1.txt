A photo embedded in a Facebook post claiming that a journalist was beaten up by police on November 5, while covering National Unity Platform presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, is FALSE.
The post says Ugandan police beat the journalist for covering Bobi Wine as he headed to his party headquarters in Kamwokya, a Kampala suburb.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the photo was taken in 2015.
The Human Rights Network for Journalists Uganda- HRJNU identifies the injured person in the picture as Mr Isaac Kugonza, a journalist working with Delta TV, a local television channel. HRJNU indicates that he was attacked while covering a scuffle surrounding efforts to arrest the Lord Mayor of Kampala City, Erias Lukwago, on Monday, November 16, 2015.
Reports claim that police fired teargas, rubber and live bullets to disperse Mr Lukwagoâ€™s supporters who were opposed to efforts by police to block him from reaching the electoral commission headquarters in Kampala to return his mayoral nomination papers.
However, the Police Spokesperson Fred Enanga said Mr. Kugonza was hit with a stone hurled at the police by rowdy protesters and not by a bullet.
PesaCheck has looked into the photo embedded in a Facebook post claiming that a journalist was beaten up by Uganda police while covering Bobi Wine and finds it to be FALSE.
