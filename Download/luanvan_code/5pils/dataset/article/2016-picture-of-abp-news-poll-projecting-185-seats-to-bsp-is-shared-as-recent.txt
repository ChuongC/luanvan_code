In the wake of upcoming elections in UP, a photo of an ABP News poll projecting 185 seats to the BSP is being widely shared on social media through a post. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of a recent ABP News poll projecting 185 seats to BSP ahead of 2022 UP Assembly elections.
Fact: The photo is a screenshot from a ABP News poll held in 2016. The poll was done in the run-up to the 2017 elections in UP, not the recent elections. In a more recent opinion poll done by ABP News, the BSP was projected to get 13-21 seats in the 2022 UP elections. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
When reverse image search is done on the photo, the same screenshot was found on YouTube. This video was uploaded on the official YouTube channel of ABP News on 16 March 2016. The ABP News poll projected 185 seats to Bahujan Samaj Party if the UP polls had happened on that day i.e., on 16 March 2016; this opinion poll was done in the run-up to the 2017 elections in UP.
In a more recent opinion poll done by ABP News, the BSP was projected to get 13-21 seats in the 2022 UP elections. According to this survey, which was done along with CVoter, BJP is going to form the government with 225-237 seats in the 403-member UP assembly.Â 
To sum it up, a photo of a 2016 ABP News Poll projecting 185 seats to BSP is shared as recent.
