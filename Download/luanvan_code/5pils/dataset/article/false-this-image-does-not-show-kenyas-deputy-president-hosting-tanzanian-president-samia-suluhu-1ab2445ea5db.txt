An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Kenya’s deputy president, William Ruto, hosting Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan at his Karen office, Nairobi is FALSE.
The image shows DP Ruto and the Tanzanian leader in a cheerful mood as they converse. President Samia Suluhu Hassan is holding a trophy in the photo.
The national flags of Tanzania and Kenya frame the left and right edges of the image respectively.
The text accompanying the image claims the picture was taken at the DP’s office in Karen, Nairobi, although it does not indicate when this took place.
The image was shared as President Samia Suluhu Hassan wound up her two-day state visit in Kenya, from May 4 to 5, 2021. The visit, aimed at cementing ties between the two East African countries, saw an activity-packed itinerary that included a state banquet hosted in her honour, and an iftar dinner at State House, Nairobi.
The following day, she addressed a joint sitting of Kenya’s bicameral parliament in Nairobi, as well as the Kenya-Tanzania business forum.
A Google reverse image search reveals that the photograph does not show a meeting between President Samia Suluhu Hassan and DP Ruto as claimed.
Among the search results is a tweet by the DP on March 13, 2019, when he met the then Vice President Suluhu in Kampala, Uganda, during the Africa-Now Summit.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook, claiming to show Kenya’s deputy president, William Ruto, hosting Tanzania’s President Samia Suluhu, at his office in Karen, and finds it to be FALSE.
