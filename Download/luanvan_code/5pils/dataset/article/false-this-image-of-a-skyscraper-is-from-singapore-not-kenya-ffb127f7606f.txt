An image of a skyscraper with a huge terrace shared on Facebook claiming it shows Tower One Hotel in Nakuru City, Kenya, is FALSE.
The text suggests Kenya’s superiority over neighbours Tanzania and Uganda and demands “respect” from those countries.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image is from Singapore. The photo is of Marina Bay Sands, a business, leisure and entertainment destination located along the Marina Bay waterfront in Singapore.
According to its official website, the Marina Bay Sands features three cascading hotel towers topped by a SkyPark, ‘floating’ crystal pavilions, a lotus-inspired museum and retail stores.
The image has been shared in several posts online, as seen here, here, and a video here.
According to the Team2Architects website, Tower One in Nakuru City is an office block on the busy Moi road in Nakuru and is flanked by the old post office buildings.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a photo of a skyscraper with a huge terrace claiming to show Tower One Hotel located in Nakuru City in Kenya and finds it to be FALSE.
