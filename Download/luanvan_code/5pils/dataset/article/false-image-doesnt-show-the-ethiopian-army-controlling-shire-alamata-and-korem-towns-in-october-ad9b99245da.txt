A Facebook post with an image claiming to be of the Ethiopian army controlling Shire, Alamata, and Korem towns in the Tigray region is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by text in Amharic that translates as; “Our Allied forces controlled Shire, Alamata, and Korem towns and now they are moving forward. Our fight is for the people of Tigray who are under the dictatorship. Guzara Gondar Gorgora.”
On 17 October 2022, the Ethiopian government said it planned to control all airports and other strategic infrastructure in the northern region of Tigray. The following day, the Ethiopian Government Communication Service released a statement stating that government forces and their allies had captured the towns of Shire, Alamata, and Korem.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the picture is unrelated to the war in Ethiopia that resumed on 24 August 2022.
The photo was posted on the FDRE Government Communication Service’s official Twitter account on 1 December 2021 alongside a text that reads: “Campaign for Multinational Unity, a photo of the victory of the factional army led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in the Gishen front.”
The photo was also shared on the BBC Afaan Oromoo website on 5 December 2021 in an article headlined, “The Ethiopian army has announced that it has liberated Kamise from the forces of the TPLF.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of the Ethiopian army controlling Shire, Alamata, and Korem towns in the Tigray region and finds it to be FALSE.
