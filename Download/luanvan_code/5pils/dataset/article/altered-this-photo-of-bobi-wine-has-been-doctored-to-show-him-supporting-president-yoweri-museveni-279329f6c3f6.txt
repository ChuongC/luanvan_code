A photo shared on Facebook showing Ugandan opposition candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, holding a campaign poster in support of incumbent President Yoweri Museveni has been ALTERED.
In the photo, Bobi Wine is seen donning clothes branded in the party colours of the National Resistance Movement (NRM) that is headed by President Museveni.
Uganda’s presidential election was held on January 14, 2021, with Bobi Wine, President Museveni and nine other candidates battling for the presidency.
Was Bobi Wine photographed holding President Museveni’s campaign banner? We checked.
A reverse image search led us to an image of Bobi Wine wearing a red beret and lifting a book with the words “National Unity Platform (NUP), Membership Register”.
The picture was posted on Bobi Wine’s official Twitter account on August 3, 2020.
PesaCheck has looked into the authenticity of a photo of Uganda’s opposition presidential candidate, Bobi Wine, wearing a yellow beret and holding a poster supporting President Museveni’s candidature and finds the original has been ALTERED.
