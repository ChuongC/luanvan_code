A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a violent clash between rival political factions that took place during the by-election in Msambweni constituency, Kwale county, is FALSE.
The image shows a crowd of people running, with four police officers in hot pursuit and a fire between the two camps encapsulating the chaotic scene.
The post accompanying the image states that the violent scene is between two rival political camps in Msambweni constituency, where a by-election took place on December 15, 2020.
The post also states that the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), one of the political parties which fielded a candidate in the by-elections, is “sensing danger”.
The by-elections were meant to fill the void left following the death of the area member of parliament, Suleiman Dori, in March 2020.
The two front runners in the polls are ODM’s Omar Boga and independent candidate Feisal Bader.
A Google reverse image search shows that the photograph question was neither taken in Msambweni nor does it capture events in 2020. The image was among a number of others published by Reuters during the post-election violence in 2017, following the disputed general elections.
The caption on the image, credited to Reuters’ photographer Thomas Mukoya, reads, “Anti-riot policemen attempt to disperse protesters, supporting opposition leader Raila Odinga, in Mathare, in Nairobi”.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with an image claiming to show a violent clash between rival political factions in Msambweni constituency in Kwale county during the December 2020 by-elections, and finds it to be FALSE.
