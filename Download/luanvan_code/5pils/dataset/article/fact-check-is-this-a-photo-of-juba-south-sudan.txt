No, the photo is of Nairobi, Kenya. 
Writer: Nancy Ceasar
A Facebook post with an image purporting to show Juba, South Sudan, is false.
The image, which shows an urban location with tall buildings, was posted by a Facebook page, Ruweng Eye, on 9 October 2023 with  a post that read: ‘Somewhere in Juba, South Sudan.’ 
The post attracted several comments with differing opinions on where the image was taken, prompting 211 Check to investigate.

Claim Verification:
211 Check carried out a reverse search on the picture using Google Lens, which returned several instances where the image has been shared as being of Nairobi, Kenya. 
For instance, in February 2021, the image was featured in an article by  developingtelecoms.com titled: “Opera Pilots dedicated chat service in Kenya.” 
Similarly, in July 2020, Ghana Medicals shared the same picture with a headline: “Things are elephant: the effects on COVID-19 in Nairobi low-income areas.”

The image has also been shared here, here and here on articles referencing Nairobi, Kenya.

Nairobi is Kenya’s political and economic capital and also the largest city. The name ‘Nairobi’ comes from the Maasai phrase’ Enkare Nyrobi’, which translates to ‘cool water.’
Juba, on the other hand, is one of the world’s newest cities and became South Sudan’s capital when the nation became independent on July 9, 2011. Juba is located on the white Nile River and is the largest city in South Sudan.  
Conclusion:
211 Check finds the post false and misleading. The picture is of Nairobi, Kenya and not Juba, South Sudan.
