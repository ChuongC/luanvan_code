A photo of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray bowing and paying tributes to a portrait of Sonia Gandhi is being shared widely on social media. Let’s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post. 
Claim: Image of Uddhav Thackeray bowing and paying tributes to a portrait of Sonia Gandhi.   
Fact: The image posted is a photoshopped one. In the original photo, the Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was paying tributes to party founder & his father Balasaheb Thackeray, after being selected as the CM candidate. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. 
When the image was run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in a tweet by ‘ANI’ on 26t November 2019. In the photo, it can be seen that Uddhav Thackeray was paying tributes to Shiv Sena party founder & his father Balasaheb Thackeray. The same photo can be also found in the articles published by ‘The Hindu’ and ‘India Today’. In ‘The Hindu’ article, the photo has the following description: ‘Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray pays tribute to party founder and father Balasaheb Thackeray at his residence Matoshree in Mumbai on November 26, 2019”. 
To sum it up, a photoshopped image is being shared as Uddhav Thackeray bowing and paying tributes to Sonia Gandhi’s portrait.
