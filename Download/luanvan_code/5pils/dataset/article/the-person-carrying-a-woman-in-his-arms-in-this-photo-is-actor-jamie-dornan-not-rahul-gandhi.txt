A photo is being shared on social media with a claim that it shows Rahul Gandhi carrying a woman in his arms. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Rahul Gandhi carrying a woman in his arms.
Fact: The person carrying a woman in his arms in the posted photo is not Rahul Gandhi, he is Jamie Dornan, an actor. The woman in the photo is Dakota Johnson, an actress. The photo is related to a scene in the ‘Fifty Shades Freed’ movie. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found on the ‘Alamy’ stock images website. The photo has the following description – “JAMIE DORNAN and DAKOTA JOHNSON return as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in “Fifty Shades Freed,” the climactic chapter based on the worldwide bestselling “Fifty Shades” phenomenon. (2018) Universal Studios”.
The same photo can be also found in several articles written on the ‘Fifty Shades Freed’ movie. Some of them can be seen here, here, and here.
To sum it up, the person carrying a woman in his arms in the posted photo is actor Jamie Dornan, not Rahul Gandhi.
