An image shared on Facebook claiming to show an Ethiopian Air Force attack targeting Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) leaders in Mekelle is FALSE.
“The FDRE (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia) Air Force has carried out air strikes that targeted the leaders of the Junta in Mekelle earlier in the afternoon today” the post in Amharic, shared on Facebook on 9 February 2022, reads in part.
“The national Air Force has carried out the attack in the location where Junta leaders including Debretsion and Getachew Reda were believed to reside based on the information it has obtained. It has also successfully bombarded weapon stores,” the post adds.
At the beginning of 2022, the Ethiopian government released prisoners, including senior TPLF officials, which the government said was aimed at reconciliation. However, according to reports, fighting has continued resulting in deaths.
However, an image showing the bombardment of TPLF leaders in Mekelle, as claimed in the post, is untrue.
Reverse image search results on Yandex reveal that the photo showed the United States Air Force in 2016. The aircraft is known as McDonnell Douglas KC-10A Extender (DC-10–30CF).
The image is by photographer Galen Burrows, taken on 24 June 2016 and archived by Airliners.net, an online resource of aviation photographs. The photo was taken in Ontario, Canada.
PesaCheck has investigated an image shared on Facebook claiming to show Ethiopian Air Force bombarding locations of TPLF leaders and finds it to be FALSE.
