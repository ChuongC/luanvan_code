An image of a policeman with a hand-cuffed burqa-clad woman is being shared on Facebook with a claim that the woman was arrested in Australia for wearing a burqa. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: The photo shows a police officer arresting a woman in Australia for wearing a burqa.    
Fact: The photo was taken in 2015 when the police officers in Spain arrested a woman for her alleged involvement in terrorist activities. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. 
When the photo in the post is run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, a newspaper article with the same image is found in the search results. The photo was taken in 2015 when the police officers in Spain arrested an 18-year old Moroccan woman for allegedly recruiting women to join ISIS.  So, the photo was not taken in Australia and she was not arrested for wearing a burqa.
To sum it up, the burqa-clad woman in the photo was arrested in Spain for terrorist activities, not in Australia for wearing a burqa.
