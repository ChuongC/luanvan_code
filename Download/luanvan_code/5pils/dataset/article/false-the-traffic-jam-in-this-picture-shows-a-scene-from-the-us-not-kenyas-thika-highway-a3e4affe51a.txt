A tweet with an image showing a traffic snarl-up and claiming that it shows the situation along Thika Road on November 17, is FALSE.
A reverse image search reveals that the photo was taken in Dallas, Texas in the United States of America. According to both CBS News and CNN, the photo shows thousands of Americans queuing to receive food before the annual Thanksgiving Day.
The CBS reported that more than 25,000 people in 6,000 cars received the food portions from the North Texas Food Bank.
This year, the traditional celebration of Thanksgiving Day falls on Thursday, November 26. It is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada that marks the harvest and other blessings of the past year. Americans believe that Thanksgiving Day is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with a photo claiming to show traffic snarl-up on November 17, along the busy Thika Road in Kenya and finds it to be FALSE.
