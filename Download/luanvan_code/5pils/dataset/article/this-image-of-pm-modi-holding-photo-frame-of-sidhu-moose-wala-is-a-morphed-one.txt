An image of PM Narendra Modi holding the photo frame with the picture of late Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala is being shared on social media. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: PM Modi holding the photo frame of late Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala.
Fact: As per the PM’s Official Website, the original image shows PM Modi holding the specimen of various Indian Gold Coins, and not Sidhu Moose Wala’s photo. This event of launching several gold related schemes was held at New Delhi on 05 November 2015, whereas Sidhu Moose Wala died in 2022. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Upon reverse image search of the viral image, we came across the original image posted on the official website of Prime minister of India on 05 November 2015. The image also shows the then Finance Minister of India Arun Jaitley and Nirmala Sitharaman along with PM Modi. Reportedly, at this event held on 05 November 2015 at New Delhi, where the Government launched several Gold related schemes.
The same image was shared by Modi on Twitter on the same day stating “A moment of pride… launch of Indian Gold coins, bearing the Ashok Chakra”. The live streamed video of this event can be seen here

A closer look at the frame reveals that it shows various Indian Gold Coins. Moreover, Sidhu Moose Wala died on 29 May 2022, while this picture of Modi was taken in 2015.
To sum it up, a morphed image of PM Modi holding the photo frame of Sidhu Moose Wala is shared as real one.
