A tweet with an image claiming to show internally displaced women and children in Kenya during the post-election violence in 2007 is FALSE.
The post, which was published on February 26, claims that the deputy president was involved in the burning of a church “full of women, children, the elderly and the disabled…” and castigates him for his apparent lack of remorse. The post says the deputy president is instead “going round the Mount Kenya region, hoodwinking churches whereas Kiambaa church is a burnt shell”. The post does not cite any evidence in support of the allegation.
But a Google reverse image search shows that the photo shared on Twitter has been altered. The original image does not have fire in the background.
PesaCheck found that the original image was first used in 2012, in an article published by The Guardian.
The image has also been used by The Conversation in an article with the caption “Residents of Sake in the Democratic Republic of Congo leaving their homes to avoid clashes between rebels and government forces”.
In both articles, the image is credited to Dai Kurokawa from European Pressphoto Agency’s (EPA).
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image claiming to show internally displaced women and children in Kenya during the post-election violence in 2007 and finds it to be FALSE.
