An image of soldiers in camouflage attire is being shared on social media claiming them as the brave soldiers of the Indian Army. The post praises the life-endangering efforts of the Indian army to protect the sovereignty of the Nation. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Indian Army soldiers in camouflage suits.
Fact: Photo shared in the post shows the Cross Cover Brown Camouflage pattern designed by US-based textile manufacturing company Gulch. The image was captured in Northwest Oregon, USA. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, we found the same photo in ‘Pinterest’, the image sharing and social media service portal. The photo is uploaded by Gulch Gear and lists the gear in the picture as their ‘Cross Cover Brown Camouflage Pattern.’
The Vimeo video on their Pinterest account which uses the same image in the post mentions the location as Northwest Oregon. The same can be found on their Facebook and Instagram accounts. The ‘About Us’ section in Gulch website mentions that ‘Gulch LLC, founded in 2014, is a company that focuses on crafting simplistic functional camouflage apparel using Toray® and Polartec® fabrics and manufacturing in the USA.’
To sum it up, Cross Cover camouflage design photo by Gulch Gear, a US based manufacturing company is falsely portrayed as that of Indian Army soldiers.
