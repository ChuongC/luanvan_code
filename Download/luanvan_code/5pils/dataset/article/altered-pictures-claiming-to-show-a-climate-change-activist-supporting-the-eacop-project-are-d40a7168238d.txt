Pictures shared on the Twitter account of Hillary Seguya, a climate change activist critical of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), are ALTERED.
The pictures shared here, here, and here purport to show Seguya backing the 1,443-kilometre pipeline from Hoima in Uganda to Tanga in Tanzania.
However, these pictures are altered. The original images are of Seguya, who has consistently criticised the oil pipeline. The activist has also flagged the images as fake.
The accounts, which forwarded the altered images, regularly post in support of the pipeline under the #SupportEACOP tag.
The EACOP project is meant to transport oil extracted near Lake Albert in Uganda to Tanga port in Tanzania. It has been criticised by environmental groups and the European Union. However, the Ugandan government supports the oil pipeline.
PesaCheck has examined images shared on Twitter claiming to show an anti-EACOP activistâ€™s support for the oil delivery project and finds them to be ALTERED.
