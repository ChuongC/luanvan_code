A tweet with an image of a rocket branded with the Ethiopian flag marking the launch of the country’s first satellite into space this month is DOCTORED.
The post is captioned, “Ethiopia launched second satellite ET-Smart-RSS today. Ethiopia launched its first satellite ETRSS-1 (pictured) about same (sic) time last year. Can you report this, instead of your negative news?”
The image on the post shows a white rocket with the Ethiopian flag near the top end of the rocket. “Ethiopia” is inscribed about midway up the rocket.
But a Yandex reverse image search of the picture found the original, showing a rocket, with the Chinese flag, and was first seen online in 2016.
A further search shows that the image was used in June 2016, to illustrate China’s launch of its first Long March 7 rocket.
While the post correctly reports that Ethiopia launched a rocket in December 2019, it was a different type of Chinese rocket that was used to put that satellite into space.
On December 20, 2019, Ethiopia’s first satellite was launched into space, onboard a Chinese Long March 4B rocket from the Taiyuan space base in northern China.
PesaCheck has looked into a Twitter post with an image of a rocket bearing the Ethiopian flag and supposedly showing the launch of the country’s first satellite into space this month and finds it has been ALTERED.
