A Facebook post claiming to show the image of West Mugirango Member of Parliament (MP) Vincent Kemosi being chased by mourners is FALSE.
The author claims that the legislator was chased from Nyamaiya in Nyamira County because voters are “becoming tired with lies from politicians”.
However, a reverse image search performed on the photo reveals it was taken on 2 September 2020 and it is of Mbeere South MP Geoffrey King’ang’i.
The reverse image search further revealed that the photo had been used in stories published by Kenyans.co.ke and Tuko.co.ke.
This is not the first time the image has been wrongfully used online. PesaCheck previously debunked the photo as seen here.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show an image of West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi being chased from a funeral by mourners and finds it to be FALSE.
