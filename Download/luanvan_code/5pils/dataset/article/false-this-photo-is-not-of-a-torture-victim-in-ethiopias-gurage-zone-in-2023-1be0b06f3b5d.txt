A TikTok video shared on Twitter claiming to show a torture victim in the Gurage zone of Ethiopia in 2023 is FALSE.
The video is accompanied by a text that reads: “Government forces are torturing #gurage [ethnic Gurage] youths in such horrific ways. Medias, other responsible bodies y’all need to pay attention. #JusticeForGurage.”
A similar claim with the image in the TikTok video was also posted on Facebook, as seen here, alongside an Amharic text loosely translated as; “Crime against humanity. Gurage mothers, youths, and even children were being beaten and torched. But they are not allowed to post their photos. A crime against humanity has been committed. It should be investigated by an independent body.”
In February 2023, residents of Wolkite city, the administrative capital of the Gurage zone in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region, took to the streets in protest against the water crisis in the area. Reports indicate that residents accused security forces of opening fire on the protesters, killing at least three people and injuring several others. It is against this backdrop that the claim was made.
However, the results of a reverse image search show that the image is old and has previously been used by different social media outlets.
The photo was shared on Facebook on different accounts in 2020 as seen here, here, and here, alongside a text that indicated it is of prisoners in Saudi Arabia.
PesaCheck has examined a TikTok video on Twitter claiming to show a torture victim in Ethiopia’s Gurage zone in 2023 and found it to be FALSE.
