A Facebook post with a photo claiming to be of former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta enjoying village life after retirement is FALSE.
The 29 September 2022 photo features Uhuru outdoors with three people.
The image is accompanied by the caption, “Retired President Uhuru Kenyatta enjoying life in the village.”
Kenyatta vacated office on 13 September 2022 and handed over to President William Ruto.
But is the photo of the former president enjoying life in the village after retirement?
We performed a reverse image search on the photo and established that it was first published in July 2021, when Kenyatta was serving his last term in office.
Kenyatta had visited a development project in Gakoe, Gatundu North constituency.
The persons featured in the photo are villagers who bumped into the then president during his visit to the project.
The ex-president hails from Ichaweri village in Gatundu South constituency, Kiambu County.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly of former President Uhuru Kenyatta enjoying village life after retirement and finds it to be FALSE.
