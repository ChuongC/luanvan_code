An image shared on Facebook claiming to show former Prime Minister Raila Odinga dressed as a witch doctor, is ALTERED.
The post accompanying the image showing the former PM draped in witchdoctor’s regalia implies Odinga is mentally unsound.
“Uhuru atwirire kimundu ni kiguruki n that’s all. Nii Ndigathura muguruki, niathii agathuruo mathare. Kana niatia njeshi (Uhuru told us that this person is a mad man and that’s all. I cannot vote for a mad man, he can go be elected in Mathare,” reads the post written in Kikuyu, a local dialect.
The image has been shared elsewhere on Facebook, including here.
However, a reverse image search brings up many articles, including one by a travel blog called ThisFabTrek.com. The article describes a brotherhood of traditional hunters known as Donsow at the Festival Sur Le Niger in Segou, Mali. The festival spotlights the unique arts and culture of Mali.
The image does not show Odinga as claimed, but rather the Chief of Donsow indicating it has been doctored.
PesaCheck has previously looked into a similar claim containing the image in question and concluded that it was false.
PesaCheck has looked into the image shared on Facebook claiming to show former Prime Minister Raila Odinga dressed as a witch doctor, and finds it to be ALTERED.
