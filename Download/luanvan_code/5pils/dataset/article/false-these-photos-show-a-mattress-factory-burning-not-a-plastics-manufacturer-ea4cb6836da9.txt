A Facebook post with images of fire and smoke billowing, with a claim that they show a plastic cups manufacturing plant burning, is FALSE.
The post, written in Luganda, a local dialect, says the fire gutted the premises of the company — that manufactures plastic cups — and which has been “exploiting Ugandans” by making them “hawk the products under the scorching sun”.
However, a Google reverse search of the images reveals that they were taken when a fire gutted the Megha Royal Foam Mattress factory in Kyambogo on January 28. The cause of the fire, which destroyed property worth millions of shillings, is yet to be established. The Royal Foam brand is manufactured by Megha Industries Uganda Limited.
The images were posted on NBS television’s official Facebook page.
The factory has also confirmed to PesaCheck that they do not manufacture plastics.
“We only manufacture steel and foam”, a customer call center attendant said in a phone interview.
PesaCheck has looked into a post with the claim that the photos of smoke billowing were taken as a plastic cups manufacturing plant that exploits Ugandans went up in flames, and finds it to be FALSE.
