This Facebook post with an image purportedly of Tigray forces who attacked Tselemt people in April 2023 is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by a text in Amharic that translates to; “It is known that the militants of Tigray opened a war against the Tselemt people. The sources said that the war in the area was carried out by Army 11 and Army 17, which is known as the Tsinat and Red Star army structure.”
Tselemt is one of the woredas (local administrative division) in Ethiopia’s Amhara region.
In November 2022, the African Union announced that a peace deal had been reached between the Ethiopian government and Tigrayan forces after nearly two years of intermittent fighting.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the images used to support the claim are unrelated to the Tigray forces that attacked Tselemt people in April 2023.
The image was published on this Facebook page on 14 February 2020 alongside a text in Tigrinya that translates to; “The protector of the peace of our people and our home, our heroic Special Force, celebrates the 45th, February 11th holiday in Adwa town.”
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with an image purportedly of Tigray forces who attacked the people of Tselemt in April 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
