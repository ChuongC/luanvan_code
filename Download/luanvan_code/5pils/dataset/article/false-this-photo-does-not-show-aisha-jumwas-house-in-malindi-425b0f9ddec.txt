Facebook post with a photo claiming to show former Malindi Member of Parliament (MP) Aisha Jumwa’s home in the coastal constituency of Kenya, is FALSE.
The post features an image of a home with the caption, “Aisha Jumwa house in Malindi… wueh pesa ni mzuri wajameni [money is good].”
The post was shared online on 18 October 2022, moments after Jumwa appeared before a parliamentary committee, which vetted her for the position of Cabinet Secretary (CS), Ministry of Gender, Public Service and Affirmative Action.
Jumwa was nominated for the CS position by President William Ruto on 27 September 2022.
During the vetting, Jumwa informed the committee that she is worth KSh100 million and that she owns two houses in Malindi and Nairobi, all worth KSh85 million.
But, does the photo show Jumwa’s Malindi house?
Our reverse image search established that the house belongs to former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. We also found out that the house is in Mua Hills, Machakos County, and not in Malindi.
According to an article published by Nation Africa, the house, with an estimated value of KSh150 million, has outstanding features, including a basketball court, an ostrich pen, a gym and a swimming pool.
PesaCheck has examined a Facebook post with a photo claiming to be of the home of former Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa in Kenya’s coastal constituency and finds it to be FALSE.
