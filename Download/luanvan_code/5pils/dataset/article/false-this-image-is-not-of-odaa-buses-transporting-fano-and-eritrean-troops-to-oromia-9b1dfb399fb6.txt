This Facebook post with an image purportedly of Odaa buses transporting Fano and Eritrean troops to the Oromia region is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by a text in Amharic and Afaan Oromo that translates to; “The Odaa bus is transporting Fano and the Shabia animals to West Oromia.”
Shabia refers to the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front, a political party, while Fano is the name given to armed and organised youths in the Amhara region.
To advance the claim, an image of people in military uniform standing next to a fleet of Odaa buses is attached to the post.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the image is old and unrelated to the allegation that the bus company was transporting Fano and Eritrean troops to West Oromia.
The picture was shared on the Oromia Communication Bureau’s verified Facebook page in September 2019, alongside a report about Odaa Integrated Transport SC importing 50 buses and opening two petrol stations. The photo was also used as a thumbnail in this video talking about the company importing the buses.
The war between the Ethiopian federal government and the Oromo Liberation Army in the Oromia region is yet to be resolved. Additionally, there are allegations about the presence of Eritrean troops in the Oromia region, with residents accusing Fano of launching an attack on civilians in the area in December 2022.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show Odaa buses transporting Fano and Eritrean troops to the Oromia region and found it to be FALSE.
