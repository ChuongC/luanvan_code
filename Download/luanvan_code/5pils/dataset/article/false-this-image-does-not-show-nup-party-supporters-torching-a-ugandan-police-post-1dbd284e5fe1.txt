A tweeted image claiming to show National Unity Platform’s (NUP) supporters setting ablaze a police post in Uganda is FALSE.
The image has been shared alongside a claim that supporters of NUP, which is led by presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, attacked police and burnt down the post.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the photo was first shared in 2009, and was taken during the Buganda riots, when security forces clashed with supporters of Kabaka Ronald Mutebi, leader of Uganda’s largest ethnic group.
The image also features on multiple news sites such as Deseret News, eTurboNews and NBC News illustrating events from September 2009.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image claiming to show NUP supporters setting ablaze a police post in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
