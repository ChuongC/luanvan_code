A photo is being shared on social media with a claim that it shows the crowd who came to listen to UP CM Yogi Adityanath in Kerala as he flagged off BJP‚Äôs ‚ÄòVijaya Yatra‚Äô on Sunday. Let‚Äôs fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of the crowd at UP CM Yogi Adityanath‚Äôs meeting in Kerala on Sunday. ¬†
Fact: The posted photo is not related to Yogi Adityanath‚Äôs meeting in Kerala. The photo was taken in Gujarat when BJP workers formed a human party flag to mark the occasion of BJP Foundation Day in 2015. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo was run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same picture was found in an article published by ‚ÄòThe Indian Express‚Äô in April 2015. The description of the photo reads ‚Äì ‚ÄòMore than 25,000 people form BJP flag as Chief Minister Anandiben Patel reads out the party‚Äôs ‚ÄúPanch Nishtha pledge‚Äù on its 35th foundation day, in Dahod on Monday. (Source: Express Photo by Bhupendra Rana)‚Äô.
The video related to the event in 2015 can be seen here. Also, PM Modi has tweeted a similar image on 06 April 2015. So, the photo is related to an event that happened in Gujarat in 2015.
An innovative way to mark BJP's 'Sthapana Diwas.' Congrats to the Karyakartas. http://t.co/DlxyrMzbX8 pic.twitter.com/HXmPnE5Eob
