A post is being shared widely on social media with a claim that idols of Ram, Lakshman, and Sita in the photo were found during an excavation in Ayodhya. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of idols of Ram, Lakshman, and Sita which were found during an excavation in Ayodhya.
Fact: The idols in the photo were found at a village in Jharkhand, not in Ayodhya. The same photo can be found in an article published in January 2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in an article published in January 2019.  It can be read in the article that the idols in the photo were found at Jilinga village in Jharkhand. Another news article confirming the same can be read here. Also, when the same photo went viral in 2019 with another claim that the idols were found in Iraq, ‘Fact Crescendo’ has spoken to the local police and other officials who confirmed that the idols were found in Jilinga village.
During the recent excavations at Ayodhya Ram temple construction site, the remains of ancient temples such as pillars, idols of deities and a Shivalinga were found.
To sum it up, the idols in the photo were found at a village in Jharkhand, not in Ayodhya (UP).
