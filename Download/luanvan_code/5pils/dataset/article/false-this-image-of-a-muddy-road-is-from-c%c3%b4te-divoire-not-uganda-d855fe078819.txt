A Facebook post with an image of a commuter taxi that appears to be stuck on a muddy and impassable road and claiming it is the road from Lyantonde to Rakai District in Uganda is FALSE.
The post praises past Ugandan presidents, Milton Obote and Idi Amin, for their developments and expresses dissatisfaction with the current leadership.
The same image is included in a Facebook post with a claim that it was taken from Kasese, Uganda after floods ravaged the area in May 2020.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the picture of the road was actually taken from Guéyo, a town in the south-west of Côte d’Ivoire and not Lyantonde in Uganda as claimed in the post.
Additionally, the image was first shared in October 2016, by Actutransport.net blog.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image of a muddy road claiming to be one from Lyantonde to Rakai district and finds it to be FALSE.
