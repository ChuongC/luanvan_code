A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack on Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) weapons depots is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates, “The drone is still on the move. It is making the TPLF empty-handed by reducing the aggressor’s weapons depots and military leaders into ashes!”
On 26 August 2022, an Ethiopian government airstrike hit Mekelle, the capital of the Tigray region, reportedly killing several people. The airstrike followed the collapse of a humanitarian cease-fire in northern Ethiopia that had halted fighting for five months.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the image is not related to the conflict in Ethiopia.
THE WEEK news website published the picture on 29 August 2019, alongside an article titled “The US, India working to modify Predator B armed UAV: Report.” The picture’s caption indicates it shows a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper armed with bombs and air-to-ground missiles.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack on Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) weapons depots and finds it to be FALSE.
