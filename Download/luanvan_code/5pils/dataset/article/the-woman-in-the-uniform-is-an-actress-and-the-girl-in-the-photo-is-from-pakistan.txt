A post with a photo showing a girl, in 2004 and 2018, is being shared on Facebook widely with a claim that she became an IPS officer. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: The photo shows an inspiring story of a poor girl (in 2004) becoming an IPS Officer (in 2018).
Fact: The two persons in the photo are not related to each other. The girl’s photo was taken in 2015 in Pakistan whereas the woman in the police uniform is an actress from  South India. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the girl’s photo in the post is cropped and ran through Yandex Reverse Image Search, a link to Flickr account of a photographer can be found in the search results. According to the description given below the photograph on the website, the photograph was taken in 2015 by Sohail Karmani in Pakistan. So, the photo was not taken in 2004.
If the woman’s photo is cropped and ran through Google Reverse Image, many similar images can be found in the search results. The photos are stills from a Tamil movie titled “Thimiru Pudichavan”. She is the leading actress in the film and portrayed the character of a police officer.
To sum it up, the woman in the uniform is an actress and the girl in the photo belongs to Pakistan.
