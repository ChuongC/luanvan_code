A tweet with a photo claiming to show three volunteers who developed Bell’s palsy after being vaccinated with the Pfizer COVID-19 experimental vaccine is FALSE.
The tweet reads: “Vaccine informed is a more accurate name. These are 3 of the 4 volunteers who developed Bells palsy after being vaccinated with the Pfizer covid experimental vaccine. Masks anyone?”
The image making the claim was also shared on Facebook.
However, this same photo appears to have been published before the COVID-19 vaccine was developed. An article about Bell’s Palsy used the same image which, according to the website, was last updated seven months ago.
Johns Hopkins Medicine describes Bell’s palsy as an episode of facial muscle weakness or paralysis.The paralysis usually occurs when a nerve that controls the muscles becomes inflamed, swollen or compressed.
On December 11, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it authorised the use of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine, which was shown to be 95 percent effective in preventing the disease in a late-stage trial.
A report by the FDA notes that Bell’s palsy was recorded among four vaccine participants with none in the placebo group, and terming it a “low incident rate”, consistent with the expected background rate of the condition in the general population.
PesaCheck looked into a tweet with an image claiming to show three of four volunteers who developed Bell’s palsy after being vaccinated with the Pfizer COVID-19 experimental vaccine, and finds it to be FALSE.
