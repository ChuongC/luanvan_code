These two separate tweets claiming to show crowds at the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition leader Raila Odinga’s political gathering at Kamukunji grounds in Nairobi on 7 December 2022 are FALSE.
The first tweet claims to show a crowd heading to Odinga’s gathering.
However, a Google reverse image search established that the photo was taken in November 2017 and the crowd comprised National Super Alliance (NASA) supporters at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to welcome Odinga from the United States of America.
Police engaged NASA supporters in running battles at the JKIA. The crowd overpowered the police and accessed the Central Business District along Haile Selassie Avenue near Uhuru Park.
The second tweet purports to show images of packed Kamukunji grounds.
However, according to several tweeps who commented on the post, the two images were taken in May 2022 and not 7 December 2022. On 15 May 2022, Kamukunji Member of Parliament Yusuf Hassan shared the two images we are fact-checking.
The text accompanying Hassan’s tweet reads, “@RailaOdinga addressed a massive rally at the historic #Kamukunji Kamukunji Grounds today where he unveiled the strong Nairobi #Azimio gubernatorial, parliamentary and county assembly team”.
On 15 May 2022, ahead of the 9 August 2022 elections, Odinga held a presidential campaign at Kamukunji grounds. On 7 December 2022, Odinga held another rally at Kamukunji Grounds. The opposition leader dubbed it a public consultative forum for Kenyans to share views on the state of affairs in the country.
PesaCheck has looked into two separate tweets claiming to show crowds at Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition leader Raila Odinga’s rally at Kamukunji grounds in Nairobi on 7 December 2022 and finds them to be FALSE.
