This Facebook post sharing photos supposedly of cattle thieves relocating to Uganda to escape a security operation in Kenya’s North Rift is FALSE.
“Pokot killers and cattle thieves currently relocating to UGANDA to avoid government hand The Lotelemoi hills is almost empty,” the text accompanying the photos reads.
The Kenyan government commenced a security operation in bandit-prone areas of Rift Valley on 17 February 2023.
But are the photos of cattle thieves relocating to Uganda?
We performed a reverse search on the first image and established that it was published by The Star in May 2022.
According to the publication, the photo is of “Pokot herders armed with machetes and sticks driving livestock in Kamusuk, Tiaty Sub-county”. The picture was taken by Star correspondent Joseph Kangogo.
A reverse search on the second image also established that it is an old photo.
According to The Star, the photo is of a “Pokot warrior armed with sword and arrows herding his head of cattle”. Correspondent Kangogo took the picture on 12 June 2022 at Kamusuk in Tiaty, Baringo County.
A reverse search on the last image established that it dates back to 2017. The photo was published in a report by Radio Jambo, with the caption indicating it was taken in Baringo North.
PesaCheck has examined a Facebook post with photos purportedly of cattle thieves relocating to Uganda to escape a security operation in Kenya’s North Rift and finds it to be FALSE.
