This image shared on Facebook purportedly of Oromia regional president Shimelis Abdisa is ALTERED.
The picture is accompanied by a statement in Afaan Oromo that loosely translates to; “Abune.”
The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church has lately suffered a leadership crisis, escalating into bloodshed. This followed the appointment of more 20 bishops for Oromia and Southern Ethiopia regions by Abune Sawiros and two other archbishops and subsequent declaration of the formation of what they termed a “new synod” called “Holy Synod of Oromia and Nations and Nationalities.”
The dispute was resolved after the three archbishops agreed to work with the existing synod. It was also agreed that the use of the Afaan Oromo language should be expanded within churches.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the claimed image is doctored.
As seen here and in the screenshot below, the original picture is of Abune Sawiros, the Archbishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. And this is Shimelis’s original image.
PesaCheck has examined the image shared on Facebook purportedly of the Oromia region President Shimelis Abdisa and found it to be ALTERED.
