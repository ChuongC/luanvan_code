A Facebook image purporting to show a bridge destroyed by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces in Checheho, Ethiopia is FALSE.
The post in Amharic claims that the destroyed bridge connected Wollo and Gonder regions in northern Ethiopia, the early epicentre of the Tigray conflict.
“Tragic breaking news. The terrorist TPLF has this evening broken the big bridge that connects Wollo and Gonder, which is found around the Checheho area,” the post reads.
The author further encourages people to fight against TPLF, adding that the militia group is “about to fall”.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture in the claim is available for purchase on the Alamy stock photos website as well as on iStock, another online stock photography provider. Alamy.com credits the photo to Sergey Nivens and indicates that it was uploaded in 2015 — long before the on-going Tigray war.
Checheho has turned into a battlefield after the unilateral ceasefire declared by the government collapsed. The war has since spread to neighbouring regions such as Amhara and Afar.
Although there are allegations of TPLF’s involvement in serious human rights violations in the Amhara and Afar regions, as seen here and here, the claimed image does not show a bridge destroyed by TPLF.
PesaCheck has looked into an image claiming to show a bridge destroyed by TPLF and finds it to be FALSE.
