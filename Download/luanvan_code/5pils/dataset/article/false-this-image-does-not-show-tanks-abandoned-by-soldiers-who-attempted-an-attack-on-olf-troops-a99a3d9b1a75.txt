A Facebook post with an image claiming to show tanks abandoned by soldiers who attempted to attack Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) troops is FALSE.
The post in Afaan Oromo translates, “The soldiers who came to attack OLF retreated leaving military tanks. The Winning of the Oromo Peoples.”
In August 2021, Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) Chief Jaal Marroo told The Associated Press that the group had entered into a military agreement to form an alliance with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in the conflict that began in the Tigray region in November 2020.
However, Yandex reverse image search results reveal that the photo of the military tanks is not related to the conflict in Ethiopia and has been used online to illustrate different narratives.
The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation website published the image alongside a headline that reads, “Field training of Missile and Artillery units of the 2nd Taman Motorized Rifle Division (Alabino, Moscow Region).
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show tanks abandoned by soldiers who attempted to attack the Oromo Liberation Front troops and finds it to be FALSE.
