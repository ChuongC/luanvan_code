A Facebook post with a photo claiming to show a woman giving birth on the street in Uganda after being turned away from hospital for lack of funds has been taken out of context and is MISLEADING.
The photo was posted on the Facebook page of the Musayimuto Foundation, a Ugandan organization whose mission is to assist Ugandan women during pregnancy and childbirth, and it shows a woman who has just given birth lying on a dirt road, and being attended to by a well wisher. The post claims that the woman was turned away from an unnamed hospital for lack of funds.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image is not from Uganda, but was actually taken in Ghana in October 2019, after a woman gave birth on Dambai Road in the Oti Region of Krachi East District in Ghana. The story and the photo were published by a number of Ghanaian media outlets, including StarrFm, GhanaLive and The Independent (Ghana) reporting on the incident.
According to the articles, the woman was being transported by motorcycle to the Dambai Health Center to give birth. However, she went into spontaneous labour before she could get to the health center, and had to give birth on the road with the assistance of two public health nurses who were in the area for routine monitoring.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a photo of a woman who had given birth on a road claiming that the incident happened in Uganda, and finds it to be FALSE.
