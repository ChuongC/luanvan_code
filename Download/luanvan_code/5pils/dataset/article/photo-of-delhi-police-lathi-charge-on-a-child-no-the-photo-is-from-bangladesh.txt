An image is being widely shared on Facebook with the claim that it shows Delhi police trying to hit a child with the baton. Let’s check the veracity of the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of Delhi police trying to hit a child with the baton.
Fact: The image isn’t from India. It shows a Bangladeshi policeman threatening a child with the baton during protests in their country in 2010. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.    
Ever since riots have erupted in Delhi, the internet is flooded with many images and videos claiming them to be of those riots. While a few of them were true, most of them were found to be old and unrelated. The image in the post was found in the ‘Getty Images’ photo library. As per this information, the image is of a Bangladeshi policeman threatening a child with the baton during clashes with garment workers in Dhaka on 30 June 2010. So, the image is an old one and is not even related to India. In 2010, workers of garment factories in Bangladesh had protested against low pay and poor working conditions in their factories. When the protests became violent, clashes broke out between the garment workers and the police. More information about those protests can be read here and here.
To summarize, the image of a Bangladeshi policeman threatening a child with the baton is being shared as that of Delhi Police.
