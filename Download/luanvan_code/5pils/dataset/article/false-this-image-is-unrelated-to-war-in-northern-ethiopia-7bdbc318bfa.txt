This Facebook post with an image claiming to show civil war in the northern part of Ethiopia is FALSE.
The text, in Amharic, accompanying the picture translates as; “Breaking news! In Kola Tenbe, the key place where the TPLF leaders used to hide has been taken under the control of our brave army.”
Another social media user shared a similar claim.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the particular image is unrelated to the war in Ethiopia. Instead, it shows the US-Ethiopia joint military exercise.
The picture was shared on the Addis Standard verified Twitter account on 16 August 2019 with the caption, “#US Army Soldiers assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment navigate a low-water crossing with members of the Ethiopian National Defense Force during a cordon & search training exercise at the #Hurso Training Center near #DireDawa, #Ethiopia.”
The same image was published on the Ethiopian Monitor website on 16 August 2019.
Efforts by the African Union, United Nations, and the United States of America government to solve the conflict in Ethiopia through dialogue have not ended the war.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show the war in the northern parts of Ethiopia and finds it to be FALSE.
