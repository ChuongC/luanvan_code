A photo is being shared on social media claiming it as the picture of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi getting his ear cleaned. Sharing the photo, this post satirically asks Rahul Gandhi why he is cleaning his ears when the worm or insect was present in some other part in his body. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Picture of Rahul Gandhi getting his ear cleaned.
Fact: The photo shared in the post is a morphed one. The original photo does not show Rahul Gandhi in it. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar photo was found in an article published by ‘The Statesman’ news website on 27 September 2021. But the original photo published in this article does not show Rahul Gandhi. Discussing the problems faced by the traditional ear-cleaning professionals because of the prolonged COVID-induced lockdowns, this article published this image as a representative picture. This article credited the photo to the ‘so.city’ website.
We found the same image in an article published by the ‘so.city’ website on 13 March 2016. This article published a series of images representing ‘desi Jugaad’ in India. From all these pieces of evidence, it can be concluded that the photo shared in the post is a morphed one.
To sum it up, a morphed photo is being shared as the picture of Rahul Gandhi getting his cleaned.
