A photo of the sun and the moon between two trees is being shared on social media with a claim that it was taken by a German photographer by fixing 16 cameras and waiting for 62 days to get the shot. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: A German photographer took this photo of the sun and the moon between two trees by fixing 16 cameras and waiting for 62 days.
Fact: It is an edited photo. The sun and the moon in the photo were inserted using editing software. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found on an art website. On that website, the photo was credited to ‘Photographer – Bess Hamiti’. On the Flickr profile of Bess Hamiti, the same photo can be seen. In the EXIF data of the photo, it can be observed – ‘Creator Tool – Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows’. ‘Adobe Photoshop’ is a photo-editing software.
Also, on his YouTube profile, Bess Hamiti has posted a video, in 2012, showing how he created the above photo using the ‘Adobe Photoshop’ software.
To sum it up, the photo of the sun and the moon between two trees is an edited one. It was not shot by a German photographer by fixing 16 cameras and waiting for 62 days.
