A photo of Barack Obama (Former President of USA) holding the portrait of Ambedkar is being shared widely on social media. Let’s try to check the authenticity of the photo.
Claim: Photo of Obama holding the portrait of Ambedkar.
Fact: It is a photoshopped image. In the original picture, a set of gloves were present in the place of Ambedkar. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the image was run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, many similar images were found in the search results. It was found that the posted image is a cropped version. The original full picture was found on the ‘Flickr’ website with the description – ‘Johnson give gloves to Obama’. Many other pictures and videos related to the event can be seen here, here and here.
It can be seen that the same photo is also available as a photo-effect on the ‘PhotoFunia’ website. So, anything can be placed in the place of gloves.
Talking about Ambedkar in his speech at the Indian Parliament, on 08t November 2010, Obama said – ‘We believe that no matter who you are or where you come from, every person can fulfill their God-given potential, just as a Dalit like Dr. Ambedkar could lift himself up and pen the words of the Constitution that protects the rights of all Indians.’ The full transcript of the speech can be read here.
To sum it up, Obama was not holding the portrait of Ambedkar in the photo.
