Viral Image Wrongly Linked to Jammu National Highway 44, Actually Depicts a Chinese Expressway - FACTLY

An image depicting an elevated road constructed over streams amidst the majestic mountains is circulating widely, with the claim that it represents Jammu National Highway 44 in India. Letâ€™s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of Jammu National Highway 44 in India.
Fact: The image shows a stretch of the Weiyuan-Wudu Expressway, which is part of the G75 Lanzhou-Haikou Expressway, situated in the Gansu province of Northwest China. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Upon conducting a reverse image search of the viral image, we discovered an article on the China-based news website Caixin Global featuring the same image. The article mentions the photograph as a section of the Weiyuan-Wudu Expressway, which is part of the G75 Lanzhou-Haikou Expressway, situated in the Gansu province of Northwest China.
According to an official press release by the Chinese Government, the Longnan section of this expressway was opened for trial operations in 2020.
Taking a cue from this, we conducted a search on Google Earth and determined that the photograph captures a section of the Weiyuan-Wudu expressway, specifically passing through the remote village of Lianghekou in the Gansu province.
To sum it up, an unrelated image of a Chinese expressway is being shared as that of Jammu National Highway 44 in India.
