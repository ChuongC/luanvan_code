An article with a photo claiming to show Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni posing with sports shoes is FAKE.
The photo shows a man in a room with pairs of high-end sports shoes, including Nike Air Force Ones, Classic Adidas Superstars and Nike Air Jordans. The photo was published alongside an article published on Bana.co.ke, a Kenyan blog, claiming that the man in the picture is Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni, and that had bought more than 100 pairs of sports shoes to increase his appeal among young voters ahead of the 2021 general election. The same claim and photo have been tweeted by Flame TV Kenya.
However, a Google reverse image search finds that the man in the picture is Zimbabwean businessman Wicknell Chivayo and not President Museveni, revealing the image was first shared in 2017 on an article about Chivayo’s extensive shoe collection.
Additionally, the Bana.co.ke article attributes the claim that President Museveni had bought the shoes to the Daily Monitor newspaper in Uganda, but no such story has been shared on the paper’s website, or on its Twitter and Facebook pages.
PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming to show Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni posing with more than 100 sports shoes he bought to lure youthful voters and finds it to be FALSE.
