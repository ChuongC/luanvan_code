A photo is being shared widely on social media with the claim that it was taken at Golden Temple (Amritsar) on Diwali. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post. 
Claim: Diwali photo taken at Golden Temple, Amritsar.
Fact: It is an edited photo. The photo has been manipulated to place lanterns in the sky. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   
When the photo is cropped and ran through Yandex Reverse Image Search, the original photo can be found in an article – ‘The Golden Temple’ by Emily Polar, a travel photographer. In the original photo, it can be found that there are no sky lanterns. They have been placed using photo-editing software. The sky lanterns photo was found to be taken during the Thai festival of Loy Krathong.
On the photo posted on Facebook, it can be found that ‘@navkaranbrar’ is written at the bottom. So, when searched on Google, the Facebook and Twitter accounts of Navkaran Brar can be found. On his accounts, it can be found that he posted similar images and called them his ‘artworks’.
To sum it up, a photoshopped image is being shared as the Golden Temple (Amritsar) on Diwali.
