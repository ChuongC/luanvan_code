A Facebook post claiming to show the conflict between the Ethiopian Defence Forces and Fano at Woldia town is FALSE.
A YouTube video thumbnail is attached to the post. The video bears a heading in Amharic that translates, “Confidential information has been released about the conflict between the Ethiopian Defence Forces and Fano at Woldia town.”
Woldia is a town and capital of the North Wollo Zone in northern Ethiopia. Fano refers to Amhara region youths.
The video published by Ethio Nas contains news about the conflict between the Ethiopian Defence Forces and Fano at Woldia town and other reports regarding the situation in Ethiopia.
PesaCheck reviewed the video contents and confirmed as the audio is taken from the official Facebook account of the BBC Amharic daily News program which was broadcasted on 11 April 2022
The BBC News Amharic reports stated there was ​​gunfire between Fano and the Ethiopian Defence Forces at Woldia town.
However, the cover image of the YouTube video does not show the conflict between the Ethiopian Defence Forces and Fano as claimed.
Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo shows police chasing protesters down one of the main roads in the western city of Kisumu, Kenya, in June 2016. The image is credited to AP.
PesaCheck has investigated a Facebook post with a video image cover claiming to show the conflict between the Ethiopian Defence Forces and Fano at Woldia town and finds it to be FALSE.
