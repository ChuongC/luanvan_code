A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Fano, an Ethiopian armed group, attacking the Wollo Oromo people in July 2022, is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by Afaan Oromo text that translates into; “Breaking News: the terrorist group Fano has crossed the Wollo Oromo border and launched a coordinated offensive. There is a big battle going on. Our people have been severely affected by the war. Let us be a voice for our Wollo Oromo people who are invaded by the terrorist group of Fano. This is a message from the people of Wollo.”
Fano is an armed youth group operating in Amhara regional state.
In a tweet dated 11 July 2022, Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) international spokesperson Odaa Tarbii raised concerns over renewed violence against Oromos in Wollo by Amhara regional forces.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo used to advance the claim has previously been used online to illustrate different reports.
The image was published on 6 April 2021 on the Coefficity News website with a description that reads, “Ethiopian soldier manning a Type 85 12.7×108mm Heavy Machine Gun.”
The image was also posted on the Reddit website on 8 October 2020 with the same description.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show the Fano armed group attacking the Wollo Oromo people in July 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
