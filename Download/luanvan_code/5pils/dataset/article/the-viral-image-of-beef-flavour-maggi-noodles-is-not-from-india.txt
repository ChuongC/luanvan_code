A message that Nestle company has started selling Maggi with ‘beef’ flavour is going viral in India. Let’s check the veracity of the message.
Claim: Nestle company is selling Maggi with ‘beef’ flavor in India.
Fact: In the Nestle India website, the range of products it sells in the country has no listing of Maggi with ‘beef’ flavor among them. It was found that ‘Beef Flavour’ Maggi (shown in the picture) is sold in countries like Australia and New Zealand. So, the claim going viral in India is MISLEADING.   
When we visited the Nestle India website to know the range of products it sells in India, Maggi with ‘beef’ flavour wasn’t listed. In the non-vegetarian section, only Maggi products with ‘chicken’ flavour was featured in that listing. 
And, when a Twitter user has asked Nestle if the company is selling Maggi with ‘beef’ flavor in India, Nestle India Care has clarified that ‘MAGGI noodles manufactured and sold by it in the country does not contain beef or any form of beef flavour.’
Hi, we would like to inform you that MAGGI noodles manufactured and sold by Nestlé India does not contain beef or any form of beef flavor.
During the search process, it was found that the Nestle company sells beef-flavoured Maggi products (shown in the picture) in Australia and New Zealand. Maggi noodles similar to the image shared in the post is found to be sold in New Zealand.
To sum it up, the viral image of beef flavour Maggi noodles is not from India. Nestle does not sell beef flavour Maggi noodles in India.
