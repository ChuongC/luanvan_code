A photo shared on Facebook showing former Prime Minister Raila Odinga holding a Bible upside down is ALTERED.
The image is captioned “having a Bible just for photo session not knowing that he’s reading upside down.”
Research by PesaCheck shows that the photo has been manipulated.
An online search shows that the original photo was shared by Nation Africa on Twitter and used in an article on the media group’s website. The image is captioned, “ODM leader Raila Odinga is pictured during a meeting with religious leaders at Ufungamano House in Nairobi on January 28, 2021”.
On closer examination the words “The L:iving Bible” printed in red ink, can be seen on the front cover of the book he is holding. The words “Holy Bible” appearing upside down on the back cover have been added.
Mr Odinga also shared the original photo on his official Twitter account.
PesaCheck has looked into the authenticity of a photo shared on Facebook showing former Prime Minister Raila Odinga holding a Bible upside down and finds that it has been ALTERED.
