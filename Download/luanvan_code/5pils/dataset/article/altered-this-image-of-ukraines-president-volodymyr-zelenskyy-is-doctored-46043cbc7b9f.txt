An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressing a presser is ALTERED.
The Amharic Facebook post translates, “we are destroying the Russian army.”
On 24 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a military operation in Ukraine. His Ukrainian counterpart Zelenskyy has used both media platforms and social media channels to address his nation and the world regarding Russia’s invasion.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo used to advance the claim has been doctored.
The original image is of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) Chairman Debretsion Gebremichael and was published on the Ethiopia Autonomous Media website on 14 November 2020.
PesaCheck has investigated an image shared on Facebook claiming to show Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressing a presser and finds it to be ALTERED.
