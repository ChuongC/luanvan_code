This image shared on Facebook, purportedly of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church archbishop, Abune Ermias, is ALTERED.
The Amharic text accompanying the image translates to: “Cadre General Abune Ermias. Abune Ermias declared more war against his people in fear of and with the command of Daniel.”
The post further accuses Ethiopian forces of committing atrocities in Lalibela Town against religious leaders, farmers, mothers, and men said to be offering support to Fano.
A similar post was shared here.
However, Google reverse image search results revealed that the alleged image does not show Abune Ermias.
The original picture was shared on the FBC website on 15 April 2023. It shows Field Marshal Birhanu Jula, the Ethiopian army chief of staff. The same photo was published on the BBC Afaan Oromoo website in 2023.
The original image of Abune Ermias, which was manipulated to advance the claim, can be seen here.
It was reported on 18 November 2023 that Abune Ermias participated in the discussion held in Lalibela, where he said, “There is no peace in war. We aim to save the church and protect the country from collapsing.” The claim was made in this context.
The armed conflict between the government and Fano militants in the Amhara region persists. Reports such as this one indicated that civilians have been killed in the conflict.
PesaCheck has examined an image shared on Facebook, purportedly of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church archbishop, Abune Ermias, and found it to have been ALTERED.
