This Facebook post with an image, supposedly of the Royal Australian Navy ships ramming a boat full of illegal immigrants, is FALSE.
The image is of two large boats encircling a small vessel. The accompanying text lauds Australia’s actions.
“Two Ships from the Royal Australian Navy rammed a boat loaded with illegal immigrants that did not respond to requests to stop. The illegal immigrants were all returned, the crew members arrested and the boat scrapped. That’s the way you do it!”
The text, however, does not indicate the date of the incident or the origin of the purported immigrants.
A Google reverse image search shows the image is unrelated to the context of illegal immigration in Australia.
One of the search results features a July 2014 Deutsche Welle (DW) article.
The image has also been posted on the website of a stock photography agency, Alamy. The caption states it dates back to 2012 and is of two Japan Coast Guard patrol boats intercepting a small boat.
Contrary to the claim, the small boat was not carrying illegal immigrants; it was carrying activists. The interception happened in the East China Sea as the boat approached the disputed Uotsuri Islands (Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese).
PesaCheck has examined the image supposedly of the Royal Australian Navy ships ramming a boat full of illegal immigrants, and found it to be FALSE.
