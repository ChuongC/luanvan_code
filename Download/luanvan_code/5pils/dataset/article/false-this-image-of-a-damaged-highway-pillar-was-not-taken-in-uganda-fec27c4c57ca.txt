This tweet with an image purportedly of a damaged highway pillar of the Kampala Expressway in Uganda is FALSE.
The photo’s text reads: “The most expensive road in the all world, Entebbe express highway, Uganda Oremwa”.
However, a Google reverse image search established that the photo was taken in Japan and not in Uganda as claimed in the tweet.
The photo, shared here and here, was taken after an earthquake in Japan.
A further search using Google Lens shows multiple results indicating the bridge is in Japan.
One of these results lead to Flickr, where the description is: “Bridge pier failure — — Japan what is type of failure ??? [sic]”. The image was uploaded on 12 November 2016.
Another of the results from the University of California’s Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Center NISEE e-Library, credits the image to Mitsutoshi Yoshimine.
The Uganda National Roads Authority also dismissed the claim that the damaged pillar was of the Kampala Express Highway.
“This is NOT anywhere on our road network! We do better than this and you know it!” the authority tweeted.
The Kampala Express Highway was constructed to decongest Kampala’s central business area. It has been named the most expensive road in the world costing Ugandans $9.2 million per kilometre, four times more than the average cost of $2 million thus driving up the total cost of the project to $476 million.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image supposedly of a damaged highway pillar of the Kampala Expressway and finds it to be FALSE.
