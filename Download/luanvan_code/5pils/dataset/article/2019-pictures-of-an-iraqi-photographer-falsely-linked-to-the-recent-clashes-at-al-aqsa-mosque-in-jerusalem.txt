A collage with a group of images is being shared on social media claiming it as visuals of a photographer shedding tears while capturing pictures at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. In the wake of recent clashes between the Israeli forces and Palestinian protestors at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, these images are being shared on social media. Letâ€™s verify the claim made in the post.
