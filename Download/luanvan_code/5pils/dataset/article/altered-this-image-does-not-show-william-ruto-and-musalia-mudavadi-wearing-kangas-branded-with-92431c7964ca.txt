An image claiming to show Kenya’s Deputy President, William Ruto, and Amani National Congress (ANC) leader, Musalia Mudavadi, wearing Swahili kangas branded with Raila Odinga’s photo is ALTERED.
The image, shared on Facebook, shows the duo at a political rally donning the kangas with the branding.
According to media reports, Ruto and Mudavadi belong to a formation dubbed Kenya Kwanza, an alliance of political parties ghat has formed as Kenya gears up for the August 2022 elections.
Former Kenya’s Prime Minister Raila Odinga belongs to Azimio La Umoja, another political formation.
“Baba the 5th, ata wao wamejua na wamekubali. Wheelbarrow imekwama ama they couldn’t see they were dressed in Raila lessos.?? (Baba the 5th, they have also accepted. Did the wheelbarrow stall or they couldn’t see they were dressed in Raila’s lessos?)
However, PesaCheck research shows the image has been altered. A reverse image search brings up a Twitter thread by Mudavadi. The thread indicates that the picture was taken during a Kenya Kwanza campaign tour in Kwale county on 5 February 2022. The original photos show them wearing black wrappers without Odinga’s face.
Another Twitter thread posted by Ruto with images from the same campaign tour corroborates the evidence.
PesaCheck has examined the image shared on Facebook claiming to show Kenya’s Deputy President, William Ruto, and Amani National Congress (ANC) leader, Musalia Mudavadi, wearing Swahili Kangas branded with an image of Raila Odinga and finds it to be ALTERED.
