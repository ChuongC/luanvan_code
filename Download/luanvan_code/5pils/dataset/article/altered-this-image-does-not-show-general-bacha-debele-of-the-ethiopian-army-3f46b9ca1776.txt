A Facebook image claiming to show General Bacha Debele of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) is digitally ALTERED.
“Breaking Victory news. Kombolcha is liberated by Tigray Defence Force (TDF). Kemise is liberated by the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). Bacha fled. The Ethiopian National Defence Force is dissolved. Major General Mesele is fled to Gojam,” parts of the post in the Amharic reads.
To advance the claim, an image showing a priest is attached. However, Google reverse image search results revealed that the image is digitally altered and appears to have merged a photo of Major General Bacha Debele’s face into another photo.
The original image is of an Ethiopian Orthodox Church priest. It was shared on Facebook on 20 August 2015.
There have been reports that the Tigray forces have controlled Kombolcha city, located in the Amhara region. Similarly, the OLA claim to have seized the town of Kemise. The claim under investigation was made under this context.
The two fighting groups announced an alliance to fight the Federal government. On the other hand, the Federal government of Ethiopia has labelled the two groups terrorist organisations.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show General Bacha Debele of the Ethiopian National Defense Force and finds it to be ALTERED.
