A Facebook post with an image claiming to be of an airstrike on West Shewa, Chobi town in the Oromia region of Ethiopia, is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by Afaan Oromo text that translates to; “ An air attack is taking place in West Shewa, Chobi. It is remembered that many innocent people were killed in the previous attack. The PP (nickname for Prosperity Party) regime is conducting an airstrike in Chobi, Western Shewa now. Causalities are reported.”
On 25 October 2022, Addis Standard reported the death of at least 68 people in a drone strike in Ofu Bekke village, Chobi district, about 120 km northwest of Addis Ababa in the West Shewa Zone.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture advancing the claim has been used online in different contexts unrelated to the conflict.
The Gazing skyward media website published the photo on 4 May 2018 with an image caption that read, “POLISH MIG-29.”
The image was also published by this website and Facebook page in contexts unrelated to the Ethiopian Air Force attack in West Shewa.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of an airstrike on west Shewa in Chobi town, Oromia region, and finds it to be FALSE.
