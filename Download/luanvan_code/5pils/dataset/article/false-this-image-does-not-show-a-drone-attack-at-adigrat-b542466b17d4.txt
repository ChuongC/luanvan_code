A Facebook post using an image to claim that selected military positions in Adigrat town, Ethiopia, were attacked by drones is FALSE.
“Adigrat: The drone attacked selected military positions in Adigrat starting from 4:00 A.M,” is the translation of the Amharic post.
Adigrat is a city and separate woreda (district) in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, where an armed conflict has raged since November 2020 between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces and Ethiopian Federal troops.
On 7 September 2022, TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda claimed on Twitter that Eritrean troops were taking offensive positions in Western Tigray, adding they had been shelling the outskirts of Adigrat.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo of a drone in this claim has been published to illustrate different reports.
For instance, the image was taken from a news report posted on the CGTN website on 26 August 2022. The video shows China using its “self-developed Wing Loong-2H UAV to assist in the fight against drought in SW China’s Sichuan”. The image can be seen in several frames from the second 00:08.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show selected military positions in Adigrat town that were attacked by a drone and finds it to be FALSE.
