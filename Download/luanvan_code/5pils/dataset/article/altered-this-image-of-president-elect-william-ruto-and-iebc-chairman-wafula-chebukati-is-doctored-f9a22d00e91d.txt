A Twitter image of Kenya’s President-elect William Ruto and Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman Wafula Chebukati is ALTERED.
The image accompanies a 16 August 2022 tweet, which asks: ‘Why skip this’. The tweet comes amid claims that the four IEBC commissioners, who denounced the presidential results, were compromised.
The same image has also been shared online in a similar context as seen here and here.
A Google reverse image search, however, brings up several results with a photo of Ruto and Deputy President-elect Rigathi Gachagua. The former is in the same attire as in the image we are fact-checking. Ruto’s posture in the photo with Gachagua is the same as that in the image in question.
The image has been used in news reports on different sites such as this and on Facebook here and here.
A reverse search of the image used in the screengrab of the post above brings up several results of the original image. Among these is a March 2022 report by Tuko.co.ke, which credits the image to Ruto’s Facebook page. The image can also be traced to Gachagua’s Facebook profile where it was posted in August 2021.
While the first instance of the Chebukati-Ruto image from a reverse search appears in November 2021, the Rigathi-Ruto image appears months earlier.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Twitter of Kenya’s President-elect William Ruto and Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman Wafula Chebukati and found it to be ALTERED.
