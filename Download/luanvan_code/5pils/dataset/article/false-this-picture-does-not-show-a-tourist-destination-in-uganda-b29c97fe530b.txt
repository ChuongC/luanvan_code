A tweet claiming to show a tourist destination in Uganda is FALSE.
The post calls on people to visit the East African country and enjoy themselves after the lockdown.
“Come let us enjoy life in Uganda. After the lock down we shall eat life here [sic]. People choose to invest in Uganda and they are not fools. They know why they come here and not elsewhere. This is my home Uganda and you can say what you want it does not change anything,” reads the tweet.
Uganda has undertaken stringent measures, including restricting the movement of people and gatherings to curb the spread of COVID-19.
The country has had two major lockdowns — in March 2020 and June 2021 — to curb the spread of the virus that has killed 2,771 people as of 4 August 2021.
Although Uganda has been named a leading tourism destination globally by CNN, the destination in the photo is not located in Uganda as claimed in the tweet.
According to Google search image results, the photo shows the Singita Faru Faru Lodge located in the Serengeti region in northern Tanzania.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet claiming to show a tourist destination in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
