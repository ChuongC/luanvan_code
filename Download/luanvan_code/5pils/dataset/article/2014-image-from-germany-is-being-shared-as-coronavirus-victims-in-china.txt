A post with a photo is being widely shared on Facebook with the claim that it shows the Coronavirus victims in China. Let’s analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of Coronavirus victims in China.
Fact: The image is from Germany and it shows people lying down in a pedestrian zone, as part of an art project in Frankfurt, in remembrance of victims of the Katzbach Nazi concentration camp. So, the claim is FALSE. 
When the image in the post is subjected to reverse image search technique, an article of ‘South China Morning Post’ was obtained in the search results. The article is dated 26 March 2014 and the image was found with photo credits to Reuters. When searched on the ‘Reuters’ website, the image was found with the following description- ‘People lay down in a pedestrian zone as part of an art project in remembrance of the 528 victims of the Katzbach Nazi concentration camp, in Frankfurt, March 24, 2014. The inmates of the Katzbach concentration camp, a part of the former Adler industrial factory, were forced into a death march to the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Dachau on March 24, 1945. Some 528 victims of Katzbach are buried at Frankfurt’s central cemetery’. So, the image is related to an event in Frankfurt (Germany) in 2014.
To summarize, an image from Germany is being shared as ‘Coronavirus victims in China’.
