A photo embedded in a Facebook post claiming that the mammoth crowd shown in the image was captured in Uganda during a rally for presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, is FALSE.
The claim alongside the photo is that the scene was captured on the campaign trail in the Northern Uganda districts of Apac and Oyam on November 12, 2020, suggesting it was taken at his political rally. The claim has been circulating in a text message making the rounds online and appears to have been created from a screengrab of Mr Kyagulanyi’s verified Facebook account.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the photo was taken in 2014.
The Zambian News Network published the photo which was taken in Tembisa, a large township in Gauteng Province in South Africa, ahead of the 2014 South African polls.
Supporters of Economic Freedom Fighters, a South African political party, are seen in the photo donned in their signature red berets, similar to Mr Kyagulanyi’s National Unity Platform (NUP) garb.
PesaCheck has looked into the photo embedded in a Facebook post claiming that the photo was taken in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
