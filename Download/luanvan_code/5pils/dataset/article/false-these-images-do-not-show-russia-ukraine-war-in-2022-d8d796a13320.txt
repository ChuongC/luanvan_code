A Facebook user claiming these images show the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is FALSE.
“40 people have been killed in a war between Russia and Ukraine using heavy weapons”, the post in Afaan Oromoo, reads in part.
The post adds that “there is high fear that the Russia-Ukraine war would lead to a Third world war. Particularly, if NATO joined the war, it would herald a Third World War”.
Two images are attached. The first shows a firearm explosion, while the second shows two armed females in military uniforms.
On 24 February 2022, Russian President Vladmir Putin ordered a special operation in Ukraine, which led to a full scale invasion of its neighbour. Ukraine, a former member of the United Socalist Soviet Republic (USSR ) gained independence on 1 December 1991.
The Ukraine government announced over 100 civilians and soldiers were killed in multiple attacks by Russia.
However, the images do not show the current war in Ukraine, as claimed.
Reverse image search results for the first image reveal a Ukraine military exercise in November 2018.
The image is credited to the Defense Ministry of Ukraine and depicts the air defence system exercises conducted by anti-aircraft missile troops of the Ukrainian Navy from 1–4 November 2018. The anti-aircraft system shown on the image was identified as the S-300PT air defence system and Buk-M1.
The second image’s Labnol search results also indicate that the picture was of female Ukrainian soldiers in 2018.
The image was archived by Reddit, a social network of communities across the globe, on 3 October 2018. The picture is captioned as “Female Ukrainian Troops”.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with images claiming to show war in Ukraine in February 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
