A photo of a huge horse surrounded by four men is being shared on social media with a claim that it was taken in the year 1910. Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.
Claim: This photograph of a giant horse is from 1910.
Fact: This is a photograph generated using Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Hence, the claim made in the post is False.
To learn more about the viral photo, we performed a reverse image search online, leading us to the same photo posted on a Facebook page named Vigour Graphics. This was uploaded on 1 April 2023. This page mentioned that the viral photo was created with AI.
Generally, a standard error in AI-generated photos is that the human hands and legs tend to look distorted and abnormal. In the viral photo, the fingers of the third person standing from the right look abnormally long.
Additionally, we ran this photograph through the “Hive Moderation” tool, which detects AI-generated content. It shows that the viral image is 71.4% likely to be AI-generated. 
Furthermore, we looked on the internet for the tallest horses, which revealed that according to the Guinness World Records, “The tallest and heaviest documented horse was the shire gelding Sampson (later renamed Mammoth), bred by Thomas Cleaver of Toddington Mills, Bedfordshire, UK. This horse, foaled 1846, measured 21.2½ hands, 2.19 m (7 ft 2.5 in) in 1850 and was later said to have weighed 1,524 kg (3,359 lb).”
To sum up, an AI-generated photo of a giant horse is being falsely shared as a real photo from the year 1910.
