A tweet claiming to show the president of the United States, Joe Biden, kneeling in front of a child purported to be the son of the late George Floyd is FALSE.
George Floyd was a 46-year-old African-American man who was pronounced dead shortly after an encounter with Minneapolis police officers. Mr Floyd’s death on May 25, 2020 ignited protests against alleged institutionalised racism in the US and across the world. A police officer, identified as Derek Chauvin, who has since been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, knelt on Mr Floyd’s neck for about nine minutes, until he eventually became unresponsive.
The incident was recorded on video by a bystander and went viral, reigniting the Black Lives Matter movement against incidents of police brutality in the African-American community.
The tweet claims that the image shows President Biden kneeling in front of Mr Floyd’s son, asking for forgiveness.
However, a Google reverse search of the image reveals that it was taken in Detroit, Michigan, while Mr Biden, then Democrat presidential candidate, was on the campaign trail canvassing for votes in September 2020.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet claiming to show US President Joe Biden kneeling in front of a child purported to be the son of Goerge Floyd and finds it to be FALSE.
