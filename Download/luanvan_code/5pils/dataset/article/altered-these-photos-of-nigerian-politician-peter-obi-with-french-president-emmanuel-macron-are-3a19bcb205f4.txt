These photos on Facebook and Twitter, supposedly of Nigerian opposition politician Peter Obi with French President Emmanuel Macron, are ALTERED.
The authors claim the images were taken at the June 2023 Paris summit.
The images were published after the Paris 22–23 June 2023 Summit for A New Global Financing Pact. The summit’s agenda was to develop financial solutions to tackle global challenges such as poverty and climate change.
We performed a Google reverse image search to authenticate the validity of the photos and the results were that the photos had been edited.
The original images are of Nigerian President Bola Tinubu and his French counterpart Macron at a state banquet hosted by the latter in Paris on 23 June 2023. The photos were published on President Tinubu’s Twitter account and Facebook page on 23 June 2023.
A Google search for Peter Obi attending the summit yielded negative results. Nigeria’s Fact Check Hub also found the images to have been doctored.
​​PesaCheck examined photos on Facebook and Twitter, supposedly of Nigerian politician Peter Obi with French President Emmanuel Macron, and found them to be ALTERED.
