A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Ethiopians affected by drought in East Bale, Guji, and Borena is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo text posted with the image translates as; “Our people in East Bale, Guji, and Borena are being affected by drought in an unprecedented way.”
On 29 July 2022, BBC Afaan Oromoo reported that at least 12 people have died of hunger in the drought-ravaged Guji zone of the Oromia regional state. Community members, however, have put the number at 20.
Google reverse image search results show that the photo in the claim is not related to East Bale, Guji, and Borena.
The Guardian News website published the picture on 27 July 2017, alongside an article titled; “Al-Shabaab militants ban starving Somalis from accessing aid.”
The picture’s caption describes malnourished and displaced Somali children in a camp on the outskirts of Mogadishu owing to severe drought. The image is credited to Farah Abdi Warsameh of the Associated Press (AP).
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show Ethiopians of East Bale, Guji, and Borena affected by drought and finds it to be FALSE.
