This Facebook post with a photo supposedly of former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga Stadium in Homa Bay County, Kenya, is FALSE.
The image depicts a modern stadium and is accompanied by the text, “Raila Odinga Homabay Stadium”.
The post was published on 30 June 2023 as Homa Bay Governor Gladys Wanga unveiled a stadium named after Odinga.
But is the photo authentic?
Google reverse image search results established that the photo is of Al Janoub Stadium in Al Wakrah, Qatar.
Al Janoub stadium was inaugurated in 2019 and was one of the venues that hosted the 2022 World Cup. The design of the stadium was inspired by waves of traditional boats used by Al Wakrah’s ancient seafarers.

The image was also published here and here.
Additionally, this video posted by Governor Wanga confirmed that the Raila Odinga Stadium is different from the one we are debunking.
PesaCheck examined a Facebook post with a photo supposedly of Raila Odinga Stadium in Homa Bay County, Kenya, and found it to be FALSE.
