An image is being widely shared on social media with a claim that the photo shows condoms found in drainage at Shaheen Bagh. Let’s analyze the claim about the image.
Claim: Condoms found in drainage at Shaheen Bagh.
Fact: At Shaheen Bagh, women are protesting against CAA since ‘15 December 2019’. But, the image in the post is found to exist on the internet at least since 2016. So, the claim is FALSE.
From the article of ‘Indian Express’, it is learnt that women are holding a sit-in protest at Shaheen Bagh since 15 December 2019 against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA).
On subjecting the image to Google reverse image search technique, it was found in an article on the news website – ‘Doisongphapluat’. In the article, no concrete information was given about that image but the article was published in 2016. So, it is in no way related to the Shaheen Bagh protests going on since 15 December 2019.  The same image is found on multiple websites and all of them were published years ago.
To conclude, an old image is being shared as ‘Condoms found in drainage at Shaheen Bagh’.
