This photo, on both Facebook and Twitter, purportedly of a second perimeter wall being built around State House, Nairobi, on 13 March 2023 is FALSE.
The accompanying text suggests the construction is in response to the mass action scheduled for 20 March 2023 in Nairobi by the opposition formation Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya.
“Happening at Statehouse Right now,a second perimeter wall is being constructed a head [sic] of the AZIMIO Historic Demo’s on 20th. Zakayo is in a panic MODE,” the text accompanying the photo reads.
Raila Odinga, the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya leader, announced on 9 March 2023 that 20 March 2023 will be the official commencement date of nationwide mass action.
But is the photo of a perimeter wall under construction at the State House?
We performed a Google reverse image search and established that the photo was first published on 30 May 2022 by property company Maskani Kenya.
PesaCheck has examined a photo shared on Facebook and Twitter purportedly of a second perimeter wall being built at State House on 13 March 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
