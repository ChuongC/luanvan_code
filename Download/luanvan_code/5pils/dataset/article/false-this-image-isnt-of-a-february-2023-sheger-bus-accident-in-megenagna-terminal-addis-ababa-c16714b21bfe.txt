This Facebook post with an image purportedly of a February 2023 Sheger bus accident at Megenagna, a Yeka sub-city terminal in Addis Ababa, is FALSE.
The post, in Amharic, reads: “Sad News: Five people died in an accident on the Sheger bus. In the evening in Yeka sub-city terminal called Megenagna, a passenger bus with licence plate number 3 — AA A 36106 AA went off the line due to an unknown problem and caused damage to people and property. According to the information we got, five people died immediately in the accident and eight people were injured lightly and taken to a hospital.”
Six people died at Megenagna after a Sheger bus skidded off the line at the terminal on 20 February 2023, Fana Broadcasting Corporation reported.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo in the claim is not related to the Megenagna accident.
The image is taken from a Sheger bus accident. The bus was travelling from Six Kilo to Ferensa, Addis Ababa, on 28 April 2021. The image was published on Arada communication.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly of a Sheger bus involved in an accident at Megenagna, a Yeka sub-city terminal in Addis Ababa in February 2023, and finds it to be FALSE.
