A tweet with multiple images claiming to show tourist destinations in Uganda is PARTLY FALSE.
The caption for both images states that “Uganda is one of the best tourist destinations in the world” and urges people to visit the East African country.
Although Uganda has been named one of the best tourism destinations in the world by CNN and others, PesaCheck has found that some of the destinations in the photos are not in Uganda as claimed in the tweet.
A Google reverse image search here and here shows that the first and second images were taken in Uganda. The first image was taken at Murchison Falls in Uganda and published on Instagram in 2019. The second image featured in an article published on PML Daily in April 2021, with the title, “Akon appointed special envoy for Ugandan tourism, culture”.
A Google reverse image search on the third and fourth images shows that the photos were taken in Italy and Hawaii respectively, and not Uganda as claimed in the tweet.
The third image is of a resort in Italy, and can be seen here, while the fourth photo is of the Tropical Estate in Kilauea, Hawaii, and was featured in an article published on HGTV website as seen here.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with multiple images claiming to show tourist destinations in Uganda and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
