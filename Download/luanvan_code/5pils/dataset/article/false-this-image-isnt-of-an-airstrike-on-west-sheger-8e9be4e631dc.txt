This Facebook post with an image apparently of an airstrike on West Sheger (Addis Ababa), Oromia region is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by text that reads: “Nyamar West Shaggar of Oromia region attacked by drone/Air strike today. Many innocent civilians were targeted. Stop drone attacks in Oromia.”
Addis Ababa is also known as Finfinne (in Afaan Oromo) and Sheger.
News reports indicate that an airstrike in Ethiopia’s Oromia region killed dozens of civilians in October 2022.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the photo in the claim is not of a recent drone strike in the Oromia region.
The Defence News website published the picture on 5 October 2016 alongside an article titled, “White House Rolls Out Armed Drone Declaration”.
The caption reads: “A U.S. Air Force MQ-1B Predator unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), carrying a Hellfire missile lands at a secret air base after flying a mission in the Persian Gulf region on January 7, 2016”. The image is credited to John Moore/Getty Images.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly of a drone attack on West Sheger (Addis Ababa), Oromia region, and finds it to be FALSE.
