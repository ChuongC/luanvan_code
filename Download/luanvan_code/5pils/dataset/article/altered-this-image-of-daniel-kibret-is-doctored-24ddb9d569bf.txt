An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Daniel Kibret is ALTERED.
The caption of the picture in Amharic translates to, “What is the point of being frustrated on minor issues? Friends and relatives do not keep silent. No matter what, he is part of us.”
A picture that shows a man lying on the floor with empty bottles next to him is attached to the post. Although the post does not mention its name, the face of the photo shows cleric Daniel Kibret.
Daniel Kibret served as a deacon in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and is also a Social Affairs Advisor to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo is digitally manipulated to include Daniel’s face. The image is created digitally by combining two different pictures into one.
The below screenshot shows the first original image that was used to create the doctored picture. As seen here, here, and here, the image was published on various online platforms and used in memes, and has no relation to Daniel.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show Daniel Kibret and found it to be FALSE.
