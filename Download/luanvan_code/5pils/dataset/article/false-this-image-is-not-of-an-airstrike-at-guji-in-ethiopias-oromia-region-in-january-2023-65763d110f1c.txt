A Facebook post with an image supposedly of an airstrike at the Guji zone of the Oromia region of Ethiopia in January 2023 is FALSE.
The post, in Afaan Oromo, translates to; “Many sources said that several civilians were injured in the air strike in Qarsa village of Galana district of Guji zone, till now the number of injured is not determined.”
Guji is a zone in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. In November 2022 there were reports that dozens of civilians were killed in an airstrike in the region.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the picture is not of an attack in Guji.
The image was published on the Savunmatr website on 29 December 2022, in an article with the headline, “Iran buys Su-35 warplanes from Russia.”
The image was also published on Wikimedia Commons on 6 August 2012 by an author from Bakashikha, Russia. A further search shows that the photo was also published on this website with the caption indicating it was taken in August 2012 and that it was of a Russian Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29S jet fighter.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image supposedly of an airstrike in Guji, Oromia region, in January 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
