A Facebook post with an image claiming to show newly installed Tanzanian President, Samia Hassan, with President John Magufuli before his death is FALSE.
The post says that the man lying in a hospital bed is the late President Magufuli, adding that the photo was taken “before his last breath”.
However, a Google reverse image search reveals that the man in the photo is not the late President Magufuli as claimed in the post.
The photo dates back to November 2017, when President Hassan, who was Tanzania’s vice president at the time, visited opposition leader Tundu Lissu, while he was a patient at Nairobi Hospital in Kenya. Mr Lissu was the Singida East MP at that time.
The image features in a blog post from November 28, 2017.
The death of President Magufuli was announced by then Vice President Hassan in a televised address on March 17, 2021. She was sworn in as president on March 19, 2021, becoming the first female head of state of the East African country.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show Tanzania’s President Samia Hassan with President John Magufuli before his death and finds it to be FALSE.
