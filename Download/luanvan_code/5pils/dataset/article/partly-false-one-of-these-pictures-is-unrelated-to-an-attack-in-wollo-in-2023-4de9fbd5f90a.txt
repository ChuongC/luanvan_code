This Facebook post with images purportedly related to an attack in Ethiopia’s Wollo zone in 2023 is PARTLY FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by a text in Amharic and Afaan Oromo that translates to; “In the Wollo Oromo Special Zone, the federal body in charge of Artuma Fursi district administration asked the concerned federal body to reach out before the people died. In the Oromo zone in Artuma Fursi district, Dimtu, Lute, and the surrounding kebeles, the extremist forces of Fano are causing great damage and burning innocent people and property, so the concerned government body should pay attention to it.”
However, a reverse image search on the first photo established that it is old and unrelated to an attack in Wollo in 2023.
The picture was shared on this website on 23 April 2021, alongside an article titled “Ethiopia: Armed Group Controls Sedal Woreda”.
PesaCheck has previously debunked the image used to advance a claim in a different context.
As seen here, a Google reverse image search on the second picture did not yield positive results.
The third image is a screenshot of a similar post by a different account.
Deutsche Welle (DW) reported there was a conflict in the Wollo Oromia Special Zone, in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia, in 2023. However, the image under investigation is unrelated to this conflict, or the incident reported in the Facebook post.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with images purportedly related to an attack in Ethiopia’s Wollo zone in 2023 and found it to be PARTLY FALSE.
