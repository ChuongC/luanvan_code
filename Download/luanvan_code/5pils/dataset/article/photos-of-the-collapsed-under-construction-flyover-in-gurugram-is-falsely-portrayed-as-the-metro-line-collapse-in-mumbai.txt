A post is being shared on social media claiming it as showing the photos of the metro line which collapsed near Phoenix mall in Mumbai. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photos of the metro line which collapsed near phoenix mall in Mumbai.
Fact: Photos in the post show the collapsed under-construction flyover at Sohna road in Gurugram, not the metro line in Mumbai. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search, similar photos as shared in the post were found in a video posted by ‘ANI’ news channel on YouTube on ‘22 August 2020’. In the description of this video, it is mentioned that a portion of an under-construction flyover collapsed at Sohna road in Gurugram, Haryana. It mentioned that 2 persons were injured in this accident.
We found detailed information of this incident in an article published by ‘INDIA TV’ news website. In the article, it is mentioned that section of a 6 km long under-construction flyover collapsed near Sohna road on ‘22 August 2020’. It is also mentioned that a huge concrete slab of the flyover fell on the road because of which two persons get injured. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Gurugram police launched separate probes investigating the reasons behind the collapse.
To sum it up, photos of the collapsed under-construction flyover in Gurugram is falsely shared as the metro line collapse in Mumbai.
