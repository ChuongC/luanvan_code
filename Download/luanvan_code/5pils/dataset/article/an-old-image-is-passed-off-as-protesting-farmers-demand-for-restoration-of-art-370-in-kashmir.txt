An Old image is passed off as protesting farmers demand for restoration of Art 370 in Kashmir - FACTLY

A post accompanying an image of protesters holding a banner demanding restoration of Article 370 and 35A in Jammu & Kashmir and repealing of UAPA Act is being widely shared across social media platforms linking it to the ongoing farmers’ protest. Through this article, let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Banners demanding restoration of article 370 & 35A in Jammu & Kashmir and repealing of UAPA Act displayed in ongoing farmer’s protest.
Fact: This is an old image. The same image was shared by a Facebook user back in 2019. This image has nothing to do with the ongoing farmers’ protest against the new farm bills. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Google reverse image search of the photo coupled with keyword customization led us to a 2019 Facebook post which shared the same image. This establishes that the image is old and is available on internet at least for a year.
Further, we did not find any latest news article reporting about the protesting farmers’ demand for restoration of article 370 & 35A in Jammu & Kashmir and repealing of UAPA Act.
In the wake of the ongoing protests by farmers over the farm bills, posts like these are being widely shared on social media platforms with misleading claims.
To sum it up, an old image is being passed off saying protesting farmers are demanding for restoration of Article 370 in Kashmir.
