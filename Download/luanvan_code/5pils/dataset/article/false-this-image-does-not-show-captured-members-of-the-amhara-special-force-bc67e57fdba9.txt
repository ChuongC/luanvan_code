An image in a Facebook post claiming to show members of the Special Force of the Amhara region allegedly arrested by the Sudanese Army is FALSE.
The text in the post claims the Sudanese Army arrested the two members of the Amhara Special Forces seen in the picture, after they took control of the town of Gendewha. The post accuses Sudanese soldiers of violating women while the Amhara people are “celebrating the arrest of Sebahat Nega”, a former senior official of the Tigray People’s Front (TPLF).
While Ethiopia has been engaged in an ongoing crisis in its Tigray region, a border conflict erupted with neighbouring Sudan, leading to a military standoff. In December, Sudanese forces moved in on the border territory at al-Fashaqa — the fertile agricultural land to the north-west of Ethiopia’s Amhara region which is occupied by Ethiopian farmers and which Sudan claims is part of its breadbasket in al-Qadarif state. This has further fuelled tensions.
However, a reverse image search shows the people in the picture seen are not members of the Amhara Special Force. The image is among a series of other photos posted on Twitter in November 2017 by a user claiming to show the situation in Libya, and captioned, “In Libya”.
The same image was previously debunked by PesaCheck.
PesaCheck has looked into a post with an image claiming to show members of the Amhara Special Force who were arrested by the Sudanese Army and finds it to be FALSE.
