A photo is being shared widely on social media with a claim that it shows the dome of Delhi Jama Masjid which has been recently damaged in the storm. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Delhi Jama Masjid’s dome which has been recently damaged in the storm.
Fact: The posted photo is an old one. It shows a dome of Jama Masjid in Bulandshahr which was damaged in 2017. The photo is not related to the Delhi Jama Masjid’s dome which got damaged in the recent storm. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
When the photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in an article published by ‘Patrika’ in 2017. In the article, it can be read that the photo shows a dome of Jama Masjid in Bulandshahr which was damaged in 2017. Many similar visuals from 2017 can be seen here, here, here, and here. So, it is an old photo that is not related to any recent storm.
However, it is true that the dome of Delhi Jama Masjid got damaged in the recent storm. Some of the actual visuals can be seen here, here, and here.
To sum it up, the posted photo is not related to the Delhi Jama Masjid’s dome which got damaged in the recent storm.
