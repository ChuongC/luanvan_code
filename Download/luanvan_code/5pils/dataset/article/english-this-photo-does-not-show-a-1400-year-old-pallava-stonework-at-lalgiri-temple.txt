A photo of what seems like an ancient rock carving of a person operating a computer is being shared on social media claiming it as a 1400-year-old stonework built at Lalgiri temple by Pallava King Narasimha. Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.
Claim: 1400-year-old stonework at Lalgiri temple showing a ‘person sitting in front of a computer’
Fact: The photo in the viral post does not show stonework at Lalgiri temple. It is an artwork by an artist named Raul Cruz. Contrary to what is claimed in the post, it is not a sculpture made 1400 years ago but a drawing from 2006. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
A reverse image search of the viral photo led us to many such images on the internet. Among them, the same photo can be seen on the cover of the book titled ‘Cosmos Latinos’. It can be read on the back of the book that the figure in the photo was drawn by an artist named Raul Cruz. The same artwork can also be seen on another website called strange horizons. The artwork in the photo is not a sculpture/carving in the so-called Lalgiri temple built by the Pallava king Narasimha.
Raul Cruz’s various social media accounts also feature similar photos here and here. Unlike what is being claimed, it is not a sculpture made 1400 years ago but a recent artwork.

To sum up, this photo does not show a 1400-year-old Pallava stonework at Lalgiri temple.
