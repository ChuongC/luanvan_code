A Tweet referring to these seven men pictured standing together as Uber drivers association is FALSE.
“The Uber drivers association,” the text of the image reads.
The image actually shows Ethiopian opposition parties who announced the formation of an alliance between them on 5 November 2021 in the United States. The alliance is premised on countering the Ethiopian federal government, according to Google reverse image search results.
On 6 November 2021, the BBC published the photo in an article: “The newly formed Coalition of Oppositions and Government’s Opinion.”
The Tigray People’s Liberation Front, Oromo Liberation Army, Agaw Democratic Movement, and Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front are members of the coalition.
Others are Benishangul People’s Liberation Movement, Gambella People’s Liberation Army, Global Qemant People Right and Justice Movement or Qemant Democratic Party, Sidama National Liberation Front and Somali State Resistance.
This coalition is known as the United Front of Ethiopian Federalist and Confederalist Forces.
PesaCheck has looked into a Twitter post claiming to show Uber drivers association and finds it to be FALSE.
