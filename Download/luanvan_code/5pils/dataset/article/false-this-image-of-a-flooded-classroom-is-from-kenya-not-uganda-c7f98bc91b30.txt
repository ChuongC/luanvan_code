A Facebook post with an image of pupils sitting on stones in what appears to be a flooded, mud-walled classroom and a claim that it was taken at a school in Busoga, Uganda, is FALSE.
The post, which has been shared alongside an image of President Yoweri Museveni, has a caption castigating the government for “closing Cambridge schools for not meeting standards”.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the photo of the flooded classroom was actually taken from Mangororo Primary School, Kilifi County, in Kenya and was first shared in May 2019.
In the same year, Ganze member of parliament, Teddy Mwambire, confirmed to PesaCheck that the image showing a flooded classroom was taken in his constituency after heavy rains wreaked havoc in the region.
PesaCheck has debunked multiple claims about this same image, with one claim that it was taken from Nigeria.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image of pupils sitting on stones in a flooded, mud-walled classroom, claiming it was taken from a school in Busoga, Uganda, and finds it to be FALSE.
