A Facebook post claiming to show the front page of the Daily Nation newspaper June 24 edition is FALSE.
The image embedded in the post maintains the official branding of the newspaper with a graphic showing the faces of Deputy President William Ruto, Faruk Kibet, Joe Sang, and Vincent Cheruiyot.
The authentic Daily Nation front page for that date has a photo of the Orange DemocraticMovement Party leader Raila Odinga under the headline “Raila allies push him to run in 2022”.
In recent weeks several social media posts featuring fabricated newspaper front pages similar to this one have surfaced and amidst ongoing political wrangles, especially within the ruling Jubilee party.
PesaCheck has debunked some of these posts, such as a doctored frontpage of the Standard and one targeting Daily Nation, and also published an explainer article on how to recognize a fake newspaper cover page on social media.
The Nation Media Group has distanced itself from the front page, saying that it has been doctored to appear as if it is from the publisher.
NMG head of corporate affairs Clifford Machoka, told PesaCheck in a phone interview that there have been several similar cases in recent weeks involving the manipulation of images of newspaper front pages and then sharing them on social media platforms.
“The doctored images seem to be part of a well-calculated political smear scheme because of the individuals whose names and pictures are being used”, Mr Machoka said, adding that it is likely for political gain.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image of the front page of the Daily Nation with a headline claiming DP Ruto and his close associates are running and profiting from a cartel and finds it is FALSE.
