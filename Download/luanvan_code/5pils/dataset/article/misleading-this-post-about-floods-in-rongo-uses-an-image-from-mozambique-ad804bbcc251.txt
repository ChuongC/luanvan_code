A tweet by Sky FM claiming to show a photo of floods in Rongo and Central Karachuonyo uses an image out of context, and is therefore MISLEADING.
The tweet, which was also shared by Kenyan Traffic, had been posted on January 29, 2020, and states that many families had been displaced by floods the two regions.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image was taken in Mozambique in March 2019 by the United Nations World Food Programme showing land covered by flood waters in Nicoadala in Mozambiqueâ€™s Zambezia Province in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai.
Another tweet from Sky FM dated 29 January 2020 on floods in Rongo used a photo from Australia. The tweet states that the Ministry of Education had ordered the closing of schools in Rongo to be closed because of heavy flooding.
It however contains a photo from an Australian blog showing flooding on the Todd River, an ephemeral river in central Australia, in 2010.
A statement issued by the Kenya Meteorological Department on 30 December 2019 stated that rainfall in the Lake Region, where Rongo and Karachuonyo lie, would be higher in January 2020 than normal.
Pesacheck has looked into an image used alongside a post by Sky FM on floods in Rongo, Migori County and finds it to be taken out of context.
