A photo of an infant latching onto his dead mother for milk is being shared on Facebook with a description ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat ka Atmanirbhar Bacchha‘ indicating it to be a recent incident. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of an infant latching on his dead mother for milk during the lockdown.
Fact: It is an old photo. According to the article published by ‘India Today’ in 2017, the woman had died because of head injury and her dead body was found near the railway tracks in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the text in the photo was searched on Google, an article with the same photo published by ‘India Today’ on 25 May 2017 was found. According to the article, the woman was found dead near the railway tracks in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh. From the article, it is understood that the police suspected that she might have been hit by a train or fallen from a train and her wounds indicated that she died because of concussion and bleeding due to an injury on the back of her head. Further information about the incident can be read here and here.
To sum it up, a 3-year old photo of a child breastfeeding on his dead mother shared as that related to a recent incident.
