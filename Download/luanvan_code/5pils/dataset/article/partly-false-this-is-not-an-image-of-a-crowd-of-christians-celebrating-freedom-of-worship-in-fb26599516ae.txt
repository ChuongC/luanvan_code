An image posted online claiming to show a mammoth crowd of Christians celebrating after being granted freedom of worship by authorities in Ukraine is PARTLY FALSE.
Part of the post reads, “Hundreds of Thousands Gather in the Streets of Ukraine to Praise the Name of Jesus, after the President finally gave liberty to preach the Gospel which was banned for so many years”.
Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe after Russia, with over 44 million people, the majority being Orthodox Christians.
Although the post claims the photo shows thousands of Christians gathered to celebrate after gaining freedom of worship, a Google reverse search of the image reveals otherwise. According to the search results, the photo was taken in 2017 during a talk by Australian Christian evangelist and motivational speaker Nick Vujicic.
The Religious Information Service of Ukraine reveals that the event attracted thousands of people at Khreshchatyk, the main street of Kyiv, the country’s capital.
PesaCheck has looked into an image post claiming to show a mammoth crowd of Christians celebrating in Ukraine after being granted freedom of worship and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
