On Facebook, a few users are posting a picture of Muslims burning an Indian flag and are claiming that the incident happened in anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh. Let’s try to analyse the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Muslims burning the Indian flag in anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh.
Fact: The photo was taken in 2015 when Pakistani protesters burnt an Indian flag during a protest in Multan. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo in the post was run through the Google Reverse Image Search, with a filter “Indian flag burnt”, the same photo was found in a blog with the title “Pakistani protesters burn a poster of PM Narendra Modi”. In the blog, the photo credits were given to “AP Photo”. On searching the official website of Associated Press (AP) Photos, the particular photo was found. From the description given about the photo, it was found that on 11 June 2015, Pakistani protesters burnt an Indian flag during a protest in Multan. They have done it in response to the comments made by Indian Prime Minister Modi, who acknowledged that Indian forces had a role in the war that created Bangladesh, which was part of Pakistan before 1971.
The photo was also earlier fact-checked by Factly in July 2019 when it was shared with a similar claim.
To sum it up, the photo of Muslims burning the Indian flag was taken in Pakistan, not at Shaheen Bagh.
