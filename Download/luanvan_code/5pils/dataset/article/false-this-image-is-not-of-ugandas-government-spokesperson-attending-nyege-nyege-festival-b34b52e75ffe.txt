An image posted on this blog claiming to show Uganda’s government spokesperson, Ofwono Opondo, attending the Nyege Nyege festival in Jinja is FALSE.
The image bears a caption, “Ofwono Opondo having a blast in a Nyege Nyege tent” and Ofwono is seen reclining within a tent.
This image is also shared on Facebook with a batch of other photos where the user says those are revellers at the festival.
The annual event, which typically draws domestic and international revellers, was held amid controversy. The concerns stemmed from terror alert advisories by foreign embassies and a section of the public who labelled it as an immoral event.
However, the photo of Opondo was not captured during the festival. A Google image reverse search indicates that the image in question is old and has been circulating on social media since January 2023.
Through this search, we discovered a related image posted on X on 24 January 2023, featuring the spokesperson peering out of the same tent and dressed in similar attire.
PesaCheck subsequently conducted another Google image reverse search on the image in the post, leading us to the image we are fact-checking, posted on Opondo’s X account.
In the post, Opondo explained that the image and a batch of others were captured during a visit to the Geno family farm in the Tororo District.
PesaCheck looked into a post on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Uganda’s government spokesperson, Ofwono Opondo, attending the Nyege Nyege festival and found it to be FALSE.
