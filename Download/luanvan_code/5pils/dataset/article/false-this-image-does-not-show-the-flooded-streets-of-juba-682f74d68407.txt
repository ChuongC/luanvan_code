A Facebook post that claims to show flooded streets in Juba, South Sudan, is FALSE.
“Juba, South Sudan today’s rain,” reads the post shared on 21 April 2022, with an image showing vehicles manoeuvring through a flooded road.
We performed a reverse image search to verify the claim and discovered that the photo was captured in South Africa. According to an article published by South African news website TimesLIVE on 10 November 2016, the flooded road is called N1 South in Gauteng, South Africa.
The image, which first appeared on Intelligence Bureau SA’s Facebook page, showed the intensity of the flooding after a heavy downpour in Gauteng.
According to the TimesLIVE article, six people died after the flash floods. Johannesburg‚ Ekurhuleni, and Tshwane roads were blocked by mud and debris, and homes were flooded. There was heavy traffic along Gillooly’s interchange, and flights were cancelled/delayed due to the bad weather. Some of the access roads and buildings around the airport were also flooded.
According to the United Nations Humanitarian Affairs Office, South Sudan experienced the worst recorded floods in 2021, which affected over 835,000 people. However, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) warned of impending flooding and displacement once the wet season starts towards the end of April 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post that claims to show an image of Juba streets in South Sudan flooded after the heavy rains and finds it to be FALSE.
