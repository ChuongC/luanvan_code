A photo posted on Facebook showing Deputy President William Ruto pushing a wheelbarrow during the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Kisii County, is ALTERED.
In the photo, Mr Ruto is seen walking alongside three other people with a helicopter in the background.
The post reads, “Hustler officially at Gusii stadium”.
This year’s national celebration of the national Mashujaa (Heroes) Day was held at Gusii Stadium in Kisii, on October 20, 2020.
DP Ruto often uses the word “hustler” to identify himself with Kenya’s unemployed youth and workers in the informal sector.
The deputy president has participated in several public rallies recently, where he hands out wheelbarrows as part of his efforts to empower youth and women groups.
However, a reverse image search reveals that there is no wheelbarrow in the original photo taken when the DP arrived at Gusii Stadium.
Emoo FM, a radio station that is part of the MediaMax Network of media stations, published original photos of the DP arriving for the celebrations on its Facebook page.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared on Facebook showing DP William Ruto arriving at the Gusii Stadium for the national celebrations of Mashujaa Day while pushing a wheelbarrow and finds it has been ALTERED.
