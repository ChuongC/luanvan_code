An edited photo is being falsely shared as ‘India flag waved at a rally in Pakistan’ - FACTLY

A photo is being shared widely on social media with the claim that India flag was waved at a rally in Karachi (Pakistan). The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance of 11 opposition parties, held a rally against the government in Karachi (Pakistan) recently. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo shows an India flag being waved at a rally in Karachi (Pakistan).
Fact: It is an edited photo. In the original photo, there is no India flag. Similar looking flags in the photo show the flag of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (Pakistan). Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When searched with the keywords on the internet, an uncropped version of the posted photo was found to be tweeted by the official Twitter handle of Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz). In the photo, it can be observed that there is no India flag in the highlighted area.
But there are some flags in the photo with the colour combination of red-white-green. On looking at the other photos and videos of the rally, it was found that those are the flags of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (Pakistan). Some other Pakistan political party flags with a similar colour combination can be found here.
To sum it up, an edited photo is being falsely shared as ‘India flag waved at a rally in Pakistan’.
