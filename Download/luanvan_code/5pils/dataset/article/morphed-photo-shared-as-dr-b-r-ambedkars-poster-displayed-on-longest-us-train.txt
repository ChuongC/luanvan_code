A photo is being shared on social media claiming that the US put up Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s poster on its longest train. This post claims that the US government had expressed their respect for Ambedkar by putting his poster in front of the US train. Let’s verify the claim made in the post. 
Claim: Photo of a US train with Dr. B. R. Ambedkar’s poster on it.
Fact: The photo shared in the post is a morphed one. The original photo shows a Delhi metro train with no Ambedkar poster. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar photo was found in an article published by the ‘Metro Rail News’ website. This article published the image as a  representative picture of the Delhi Metro rail. The original photo of the Delhi metro rail does not show Ambedkar’s poster placed on it.
Several other news websites have also published the original image of the Delhi metro rail by crediting the photo to PTI. They can be seen here, here and here. On comparing the original image with the one shared in the post, it can be confirmed that the photo shared in the post is a morphed one. The Times of India also published an article reporting the viral photo circulating on social media as fake.
To sum it up, a morphed photo is being shared as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s poster displayed on longest US train.
