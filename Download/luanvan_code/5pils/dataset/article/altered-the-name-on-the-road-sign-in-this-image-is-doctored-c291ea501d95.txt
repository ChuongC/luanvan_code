An image shared on Facebook claiming to show a road named “Tialala Tibiim Way” is ALTERED.
The image shows two men posing next to signage at a road junction; two arms of the sign indicate Langata Road while the other arm reads Tialala Tibiim Way.
The post accompanying the image asks who between former President Mwai Kibaki and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga should have a road named after them.
A closer look at the image reveals inconsistencies in the font type and typeface of the text on the road signage.
A reverse image search brings up a number of news articles containing the image, including one by Citizen Digital reporting about the renaming of the road. The image has not been credited to any photographer. The signage does not read Tialala Tibiim Way as claimed but Raila Odinga Way, indicating that the image has been doctored.
Until recently, Raila Odinga Way was known as Mbagathi Way. The renaming of the road came after the member of county assembly for Makongeni ward, Peter Imwatok, tabled a motion on the same on 7 October 2021.
He argued that the renaming of the road was in recognition of Odinga’s contribution to the development and growth of the Kenyan state including “his selfless sacrifice in championing for good governance, democratic space and development of infrastructure for the period of his entire adult life.”
PesaCheck has looked into the image shared on Facebook claiming to show a road named “Tibim Tialala Way”, and finds it to be ALTERED.
