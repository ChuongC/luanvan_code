A photo of Congress rebel leader Sachin Pilot along with BJP Party president JP Nadda is being shared on social media with a claim that Sachin Pilot resigned from Congress and has joined BJP. Sachin Pilot, a well-known Congress leader who was the Deputy CM of the Rajasthan has now openly revolted against his own party. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Congress rebel leader Sachin Pilot joining BJP.
Fact: The photo shared in the post is an edited one. It is true that Rajasthan Congress Leader Sachin Pilot rebelled against his own party. But he told media that he is not going to join the BJP. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search, it is found that the photo is an edited version of Jyotiraditya Scindia’s photo of joining BJP. The original photo was captured when Scindia joined the BJP in the presence of JP Nadda in March 2020. This is photoshopped with Sachin Pilot’s face.
Sachin Pilot, a Congress leader who worked as the Deputy CM of Rajasthan, openly revolted against his own party. Due to his actions, Congress sacked Sachin Pilot from the post of Deputy CM, as well as from the State Party President post. There is no official statement from Sachin Pilot about leaving the Congress Party as of now. But, he informed media that he has no plans of joining the BJP.
To sum it up, morphed photo of Jyotiraditya Scindia is being falsely shared as Sachin Pilot joining the BJP.
