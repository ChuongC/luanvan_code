This image on Twitter supposedly of Oromo militants in Alem Tena City in June 2023 is ALTERED.
The accompanying text reads: “#AlemTenaMassacre. June 27/2023. Alem Tena city, Oromia region, Amhara ethnics have been attacked by Oromo militants living in the area since last night. They were slaughtered & burned houses. #AmharaGenocide.”
The picture used to advance the claim is of military vehicles with a flag used by both the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA).
OLF is an opposition political party in Ethiopia, which broke ties with its military wing, OLA, in 2019, and became a legally registered political party.
However, Google and Bing reverse image search results established that the picture is doctored.
The original picture was shared on this website in 2021 and it is about the Ethiopian flags hoisted on military vehicles.
Similarly, the original photo was published on this Facebook account in 2020 and on Reddit a year ago.
The conflict in the Oromia region remains unresolved. In May 2023, the Ethiopia Peace Observatory reported 58 incidents of political violence that resulted in 203 fatalities. However, the image attached to the tweet is not about those incidents.
PesaCheck has examined an image supposedly of Oromo militants in Alem Tena City in June 2023 and found it to be ALTERED.
