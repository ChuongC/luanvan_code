This Facebook post with images claiming to show scenes of a car crash that occurred in August 2022 and identities of its victims is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates, “Shocking. Breaking news. Let’s share and connect them with their families. Rest in Peace. Today August 30/08/2022 at around 6:00 PM, a Tata bus carrying 68 passengers from Eli Gabrie to Addis Ababa brake overturned and killed including the driver and 12 of the 68 passengers on the bus. Therefore, since their families have not been known yet, their identifications and photos have been released on Telegram. You can find it by clicking the link.”
Similar claims were shared here and here.
A link that directs to a private Telegram Channel is attached to the post. A review of the channel provides no information about the claimed accident. The contents of the channel include a call for users to “join Illuminati and become rich” and medical-related posts.
In addition, four images that are digitally combined into one are attached to the post. However, a search on Facebook and Google using the keywords “car accident” and “car accident pesacheck” respectively revealed that the images are old.
As seen here and here, the first image was shared on Facebook by various social media users in 2018.
The other two images, which claim to show victims of the accident, have previously been debunked by PesaCheck as they were used to advance a similar claim along with another photo.
The last image shows a lit candle with text that reads, “Rest in Peace.”
All these images have previously been shared on different online platforms.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with images claiming to show an accident and the victims of the car crash that occurred in August 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
