This Facebook post with an image claiming to show Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) militants who surrendered to Fano in Kobo in August 2022 is FALSE.
Part of the Amharic post translates as; “Fifty militants who betrayed the TPLF surrendered to Fano in Kobo. However, TPLF dismissed it as false. TPLF told VOA radio that neither refugees nor soldiers flee to Kobo. Sources in the area confirmed that this week alone, two thousand Tigrian origins entered Kobo, and fifty militants surrendered to Fano. The refugees are located in the South Wollo Haik Jari shelter.”
However, results from a Google reverse image search showed that the claimed image has been online since 2021.
The image was shared on this Facebook account on 29 June 2021 to advance a post that reads: “TDF has started to move to Wolqait, Tsegede, Humera and Raya. A strong strike is expected there. Victory and glory to the hardworking. From Wolaita.”
The same image was also published on this Facebook account in 2021. According to the edit history of the post, the image was added on 4 January 2021.
According to a report published by Voice of America (VOA) on 22 August 2022, the Raya Kobo Government Communications Service Office of the North Wollo Zone said that “five thousand people who have been displaced from various areas of the Tigray region have arrived at the Kobo Police Station”.
“The Tigray Region Government Communications Bureau also said that ‘after gathering Tigrian ethnic from different areas in the Amara region and putting them there, they say that they are displaced people’,” the report adds.
The war in the northern parts of Ethiopia resumed in August 2022 after a five-month cessation of hostilities that began in March 2022.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show TPLF militants who surrendered to Fano in Kobo in August 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
