This Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack on a World Food Program (WFP) truck in Tigray is FALSE.
The picture has an accompanying text in Amharic that translates as; “The fascist’s drone strike! Today, the Ethiopian invasion force attacked a WFP humanitarian aid truck that was travelling from the Shire area to Zana with a drone. The invader continues to attack innocent people and property. But there cannot be a struggle that ends here. #TigrayUnderDroneStrike.”
This is a similar claim.
AlJazeera and Reuters reported that debris from a drone strike in Tigray hit the WFP’s truck. The Ethiopian Federal Government communication service office accused the Tigray forces of using international organisations’ trucks meant to deliver humanitarian aid to transport fighters.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the claimed image is old and unrelated to the drone attack in Tigray.
The picture was shared on the Getty Images website on 8 August 2007. “An MQ-9 Reaper flies by August 8, 2007, at Creech Air Force Base in Indian Springs, Nevada,” the accompanying caption reads. Image credit is given to Ethan Miller/Getty Images.
As seen here and here, the same picture was published on other websites.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack on a World Food Program truck in Tigray and finds it to be FALSE.
