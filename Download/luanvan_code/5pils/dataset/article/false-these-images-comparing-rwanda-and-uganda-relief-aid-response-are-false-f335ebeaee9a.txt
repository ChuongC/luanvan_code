A Facebook post claiming to contrast the kind of relief aid Rwanda and Uganda governments distributed to their citizens is FALSE.
The post shows two images; one of food relief distributed by the government of Rwanda, and another of cars given out by Uganda to Members of Parliament.
“Rwanda Government gives citizens COVID relief food,” the first photo’s caption reads. That of the second photo reads, “Uganda Government gives 549 MPs cars,”
The world has been grappling with COVID-19, a disease caused by the SARS- CoV-2 virus, since it was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
The disease that has killed over 4.2 million people worldwide, has forced Rwanda and Uganda to undertake stringent measures including restricting movement of people and gatherings to curb the spread of the highly contagious virus.
In July 2021, Rwanda instituted a lockdown in Kigali, the capital, and eight other districts.
Uganda has also had two major lockdowns — in March 2020 and June 2021 — to curb the spread of the virus that has killed 2,661 people in the country, as at July 2021.
Several businesses and livelihoods were affected due to these closures. In July, the Ugandan government offered cash relief to the most vulnerable during the second lockdown in an attempt to alleviate their plight.
Weeks later, the government released Ush 200 million to each Member of Parliament to purchase cars.
The post in question thus juxtaposes Rwanda and Uganda’s COVID-19 relief interventions by laying photos of each scenario side-by-side and captioning them “One country has leaders, another one has Pigs for leaders”. Neither photo is relevant to the claim.
A Google reverse search of the image that supposedly shows Uganda’s COVID-19 relief interventions reveals that it appeared online around June 2017 and not 2021 as purported in the claim.
However, a Google reverse search of the image purportedly showing the Rwandan scenario reveals that it was taken in Gambia in March 2019, before the first case of COVID-19 was discovered.
PesaCheck has looked into photos contrasting relief aid given to nationals by the governments of Rwanda and Uganda during COVID-19 lockdown and finds it to be FALSE.
