A Facebook post with a photo claiming to show a Zambian man who fainted after knowing he had been sabotaged by his wife is FALSE.
The post, in Amharic, was shared on 10 July 2022 and reads in part; “Husband and wife were living in Kasama city in Zambia for 15 years and the husband fainted after learning he was paying 3500 Zambian Kwacha rental fee for a house owned by his own wife”.
“The husband had been renting his own wife’s house for 15 years and he fainted as he learnt the truth,” the post adds.
The photo was also shared here and here with the same descriptions.
The picture shows a man on a stretcher and being carried by a crowd.
However, the photo doesn’t show a Zambian man as claimed by the post.
Results of a reverse image search show that the photo is an accident survivor in Nigeria in 2019.
The photo was originally published by the European Pressphoto Agency (EPA) in March 2019.
It shows rescue workers carrying a man rescued from the scene of a building collapse in Ita Faji in Lagos, Nigeria, on 13 March 2019. BBC also posted the photo under the segment “Africa’s week in pictures”. The caption corroborates with that of the EPA.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared on Facebook claiming to show a Zambian man, who collapsed after knowing he was sabotaged by his wife, and finds it to be FALSE.
