A photo of a lighthouse with a massive cloud formation in the sky is being shared widely on social media. The post claims that the lighthouse seen in the image is the Portland Headlight in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, USA. Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.
Claim: Photo of the Portland Headlight captured during a heavy cloud formation in the sky.
Fact: This image is created by an Artist named Brent Shavnore by using photo editing software. Shavnore uploads his artwork on Instagram, most of which is related to massive thunderous cloud formation. Hence the claim made in the post is False.
To verify the claim made in the post, we searched the internet for pictures of the Portland Headlight during storms or cyclones. This search did not lead us to any news articles or credible sources that contained the viral photo.
Further, performing a reverse image search of the viral photo on Google led us to an Instagram account that uploaded the same photo on 19 January 2023. This account belongs to an artist named Brent Shavnore.

Brent Shavnore uploads artwork made using editing softwate on his Instagram. Most of his photos contain massive cloud formations in the sky. Shavnore even uploaded tutorials of photo editing tools like Photoshop and Lightroom on his website.

To sum up, a digitally altered photo of the Portland Headlight is being shared as a real photo captured during heavy cloud formation.
