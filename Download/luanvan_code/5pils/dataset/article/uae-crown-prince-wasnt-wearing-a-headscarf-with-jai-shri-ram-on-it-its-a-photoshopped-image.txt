On social media, an image of UAE Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahya wearing a ‘Jai Shri Ram’ headscarf when Modi met him is doing the rounds. Let’s try to check the veracity of that image.
Claim: UAE Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahya wore a ‘Jai Shri Ram’ headscarf when Modi met him.
Fact: The image was taken when Modi was conferred with UAE’s highest civilian award ‘Order of Zayed’. The press coverage of this event shows Prince wearing a plain ‘white’ headscarf. So, the image is a photoshopped one. Hence, the claim is FALSE.
When the image in the post is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, search results were obtained about UAE Crown Prince conferring Modi with the country’s highest civilian award ‘Order of Zayed’. The original image of the one posted on Facebook was found in the article of a UAE newspaper ‘National’ that reported about the event.
When referred to the ‘ANI’ coverage of this event, it can be clearly seen that UAE Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahya was wearing a plain ‘white’ headscarf during the event. So, the image of UAE Crown Prince wearing a headscarf with ‘Jai Shri Ram’ printed on it is a photoshopped one.
To conclude, UAE Crown Prince wasn’t wearing a headscarf with ‘Jai Shri Ram’ printed on it when Modi met him. It is a photoshopped image.
