Images shared on Facebook claiming to show the ongoing demonstrations along the Kasarani-Mwiki road in Nairobi are MISLEADING.
While there have been protests on the Kasarani-Mwiki road that started on January 13 when matatu operators went on strike over the poor state of roads in the area, these photos do not show the actual situation in Kasarani, and have been taken out of context.
The first photo has also been shared on the Wanjiku Revolution Group, claiming to show protesters carrying the body of a protestor who was killed during the demonstrations.
A reverse image search of the first photo shows that it was used in a 2015 article on protests in Kasarani over the state of the roads in the area by Nairobi Wire.
A reverse image search of the second photo shows pupils at Langata Road Primary School in Nairobi protesting over alleged grabbing of their school playground. The image accompanied an article published by the Daily Mail in January 2015. The image was credited to Dai Kurokawa of the European Pressphoto Agency, but this attribution was cropped out of the photo shared on the Facebook post.
PesaCheck has looked into a post claiming to show images of the ongoing demonstrations along the Kasarani-Mwiki road and finds them to be FALSE.
