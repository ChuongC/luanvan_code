An image posted on Facebook with a claim that North Korea deployed 100,000 troops on the Russian border is FALSE.
The post in Amharic reads; “A very dangerous decision. North Korea suddenly deployed 100,000 troops on the Russian border. This was done aiming to attack Ukraine on the side of the Russians. North Korea said America’s geopolitics will not succeed as long as it exists. North Korea and Eritrea are amongst the few countries in the world that supported Russia at the UN.”
The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine (from 24 February 2022) has been described as “the biggest threat to peace and security in Europe since the end of the Cold War”, which Russian President Vladimir Putin termed a “special military operation”.
On 5 August 2022, the New York Post reported that 100,000 North Korean “volunteers,” armed with “counter battery experience,” could be deployed to assist the Russian military effort in Ukraine.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo advancing the claim has been used online in different contexts, unrelated to Russia.
The Reuters website published it on 29 April 2022, in an article about the North Korean leader calling for a stronger military.
The caption accompanying the picture reads: “North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meets troops who have taken part in the military parade to mark the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People’s Revolutionary Army on 29 April 2022.” The image is credited to North Korea’s Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) via Reuters.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show that North Korea deployed 100,000 troops on the Russian border and finds it to be FALSE.
