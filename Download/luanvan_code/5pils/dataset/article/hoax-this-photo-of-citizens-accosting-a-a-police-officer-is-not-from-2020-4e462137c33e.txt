A Facebook post claiming that a police officer was beaten by residents of Nyamira for enforcing the COVID-19 curfew too early is FALSE.
The post contains an image showing an officer wearing a high visibility jacket lying on the ground, surrounded by citizens. The officer was apparently accosted by citizens for chasing residents from the market before 7pm, the official time of the curfew.
This is after President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a nationwide curfew from 7pm to 5am beginning Friday, March 27. However, the first day of the curfew was marked with chaos, with police being accused of using excessive force on citizens.
A reverse image search shows that the photo is of a traffic police officer who was arrested in Nyeri by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission for allegedly collecting bribes from motorists in June 2017.
Kenya has recorded 38 cases of COVID-19 so far with one recovery and one death.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared in a post claiming to show that a police officer was beaten in Nyamira for enforcing curfew before 7pm on March 27 and finds it to be FALSE.
