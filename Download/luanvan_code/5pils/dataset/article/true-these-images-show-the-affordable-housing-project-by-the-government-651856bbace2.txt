A Facebook post purporting to show the ongoing construction works of the affordable housing project at Park Road in Ngara, Nairobi County on May 9 is TRUE.
The post, which had been queued as potentially false, claims that the Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development, James Macharia inspected the construction works at the site on May 9. The CS was accompanied by the Deputy Head of Public Service, Wanyama Musiambo, and the Trade, Industry and Cooperatives CS Peter Munya during the inspection of the project, which falls under the housing pillar of President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s Big Four Agenda.
A look at the Facebook account that posted the images shows that it is the official Facebook page of Transport Cabinet Secretary, James Macharia.
According to CS Macharia, the housing project in Ngara began two months ago, with the first units expected to be complete by September this year.
An internet search reveals that CS Munya also shared the images on his Facebook page, adding that the project will create opportunities for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the Jua Kali sector.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the photos show the ongoing construction works of the affordable housing project at Park Road in Ngara, Nairobi and finds it to be TRUE.
