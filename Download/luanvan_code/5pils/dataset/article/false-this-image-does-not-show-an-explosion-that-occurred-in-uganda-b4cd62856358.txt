A Twitter post claiming to show an image of the explosion that occurred in Kampala is FALSE.
One person was reported dead and several others injured in an explosion that occurred at a pork eatery in Komamboga, a Kampala suburb, on 24 October 2021.
Police revealed that the explosion resulted from a crudely made improvised explosive device assembled using local materials including nails and other metallic fragments with all indications suggesting an act of domestic terror. No arrests have been made so far.
The post reads: “Bomb blast at Digida kyanja komamboga, 2 people dead others injured Survived thank God,” and is accompanied by an image showing a huge fire.
However, a Google reverse search of the image reveals that the image is representative and has been used severally to show explosions, as seen here and here.
Additionally, the Assistant Inspector General of Police Asan Kasingye has also confirmed that the image is not of the Kampala bomb scene.
PesaCheck has looked into a post claiming to show an image of the explosion that occurred in Kampala and finds it to be FALSE.
