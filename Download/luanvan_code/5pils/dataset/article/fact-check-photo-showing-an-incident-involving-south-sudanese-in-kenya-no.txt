A Facebook post published by Sixty 4 Tribes Press claiming that dozens of South Sudanese were injured during a community association election petition in Kenya is false.
“Dozens were injured during the Warrap State Community Association election petition in Kenya after one of the candidates was cornered by goons hired by an embassy official,” partly reads the post shared on Monday, 3rd October 2022.
The Facebook post was also followed with a lot of hashtags which is a red flag for potential disinformation campaign.
The article as put by the page.
An official at the Embassy of South Sudan in Nairobi dismissed the news as false. He said there was no Warrap Community Association election held around the time of the report. 
211 Check also ran a Google reverse image search of the picture used in the post, and the results showed that the image was first used by a Kenyan Newspaper, Business Daily in an article “Tycoon’s Sons in vicious fight for control of Nairobi Ambassadeur hotel” published on Wednesday, January 18th, 2017.
The same image as used in 2017
Conclusion:
211 Check finds the Facebook post claiming that dozens South Sudanese were injured during a community association election petition in Kenya false. The Embassy of South Sudan in Nairobi dismissed the news as false and the image used in the post is of unrelated event in 2017.
