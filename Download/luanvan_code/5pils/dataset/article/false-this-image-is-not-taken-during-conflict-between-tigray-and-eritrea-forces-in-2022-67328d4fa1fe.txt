A post shared on Facebook with an image claiming to show conflict between Tigray and Eritrea forces in 2022 is FALSE.
“Breaking information. The heroic Eritrean army says it has completely destroyed the TPLF. Although the TPLF attempted to attack Eritrea overnight through Adi Tsetser and Rama, its troops were completely destroyed. Eritrea’s defence sources say that although TPLF recruited children under the age of 18 en masse and sent them into Eritrea, no one has come out. After the defeat, the TPLF withdrew its troops even from the border,” the text, in Amharic states.
The post is accompanied by an image of a group of people in military uniform and holding weapons. But Google and Yandex reverse image search results reveal that the claimed image is old. It has been online since 2019.
The image was shared on this Twitter account on 25 May 2019 with a caption that says, “Eritrea army during independence day celebrations.” Similarly, the same image was posted on this Twitter account along other pictures on 14 May 2020.
Although the picture attached to the post under investigation is old, it was reported that there was a conflict between the Tigray and Eritrean forces. For instance, a BBC Amharic report published on 10 May 2022 says Tigray forces launched an attack on areas bordering Eritrea.
Since the war in Tigray broke out in November 2020, various reports indicate that Eritrean troops are fighting Tigray’s forces in collaboration with the Ethiopian government, as seen here and here.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook image claiming to show the recent conflict between Tigray and Eritrea forces and finds it to be FALSE.
