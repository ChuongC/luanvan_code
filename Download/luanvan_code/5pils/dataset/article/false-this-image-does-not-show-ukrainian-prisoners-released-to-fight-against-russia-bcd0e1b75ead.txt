An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Ukrainian prisoners released by the country’s authorities to bolster the fight against Russian invasion in 2022 is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates, “Breaking news. Ukraine released its prisoners to let them fight against Russia. To add strength to the ongoing war with Russia, Ukraine released prisoners that have combat skills. Ukrainian President Zeleninsky has announced that 4,500 Russian soldiers have been killed and called for the remaining troops to surrender.”
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image has no relation to the current Ukraine-Russian war.
The image was published on the Portland Press Herald website in August 2014. The description of the photo reads, “Inmates stand in a yard at a high-security facility in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, on Monday. Authorities say more than 100 prisoners fled from the facility after it was hit by shelling.” The image credit is given to the Associated Press.
The same image has been shared on other websites, as seen here and here in 2014. There are reports by ABC News and Independent indicating that Ukraine will release prisoners with combat experience to let them fight against the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into the image shared on Facebook claiming to show Ukrainian prisoners released to fight against Russia in the ongoing war and found it to be FALSE.
