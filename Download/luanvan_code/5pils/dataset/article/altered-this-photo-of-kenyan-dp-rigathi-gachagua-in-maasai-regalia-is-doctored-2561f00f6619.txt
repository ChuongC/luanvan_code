This photo on Facebook, supposedly of Kenyan Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua in Maasai cultural regalia is ALTERED.
The photo was posted on 24 August 2023 accompanied by the text, “Ole Riggy G last man standing.”
The Deputy President attended the Maa Cultural Festival closing ceremony in Narok County on 24 August 2023.
President William Ruto and Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi had also attended the occasion, albeit on separate days.
But is the photo authentic?
A Google reverse image search established that the original photo is of a Maasai warrior in Tanzania. According to Dreamstime and iStock, the photo was taken on 7 September 2019 in Arusha.
Besides, the photos shared by Gachagua from the Maa Cultural Festival differ from the one we are investigating.
PesaCheck investigated a photo on Facebook, supposedly of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua in Maasai cultural regalia, and found it to be ALTERED.
