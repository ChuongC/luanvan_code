A Facebook post with an image showing a ‘reversible’ condom by Durex is FAKE.
The post claims the condom can be used more than once. Its package pack has a text reading, “Two-sided condoms for repeat wear.”
However, the image appears to be digitally manipulated as Durex’s official website doesn’t list it as one of its products.
Reckitt, the company that manufactures the Durex brand, told PesaCheck that the image was fabricated, and they have not created a reversible product.
“At Reckitt, consumer safety is our top priority. We are aware of fabricated imagery and false reports stating that Durex has created a reversible condom. Durex condoms are designed to be used once and disposed of — incorrect use diminishes the protective effect of condoms by leading to breakage, slippage or leakage,” the company explained in an email.
The World Health Organisation indicates that correct and consistent condom use effectively prevents unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image showing a ‘reversible’ condom pack by Durex and finds it to be FAKE.
