A photo of Akshay Kumar holding the ABVP flag is being circulated on Facebook with a claim that Akshay Kumar is supporting ABVP at JNU. Let’s try to analyse the authenticity of the claim made in the post.
Claim:A photo of Akshay Kumar supporting ABVP by holding the ABVP flag at JNU.
Fact: Akshay Kumar has tweeted in 2018 that the photo is related to Delhi University’s ‘Women Marathon’. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo in the post was searched using Google reverse image technique, many search results with the photo of Akshay Kumar holding the ABVP flag were found. From an article published by ‘Prokerala’ in January-2018, it is understood that the photo is related to the flagging off ceremony of Women Marathon at the Delhi University (DU) (not JNU) by Akshay Kumar. Even, Akshay Kumar has tweeted in 2018 that the photo is related to Delhi University’s Women Marathon.
To summarize, a photo related to Delhi University’s Women Marathon is being falsely shared as that of Akshay Kumar supporting ABVP at JNU
