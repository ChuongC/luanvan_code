This Facebook image post claiming to show an airstrike around Ethiopia’s Ambo town in November 2022 is FALSE.
Shared on 16 November 2022, the image is of a jet with an Ethiopian flag on it and an accompanying text that reads: “Abiy’s air force sent its bomber jet to attack civilian targets in and outside Wadesa nearby Ambo town. Abiy attacked villages in the Ambo district with air forces.”
Ambo town is in the West Shewa Zone of the Oromia Region, west-central Ethiopia.
On 27 October 2022, Reuters reported accusations by two organisations in Oromia that the government was carrying out air strikes in the region.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo of a jet used in the claim has been online.
A-10C Thunderbolt II Demonstration Team’s official Facebook page posted the image on 29 October 2022, with the quote: “Our team is ready to attack our next air show weekend! We hope to see everyone out at the @atlantaairshow next weekend, November 5–6.”
The A-10C Thunderbolt II Demonstration Team is a unit of the US Air Force based in Arizona. The unit takes part in airshows across the United States and is responsible for recruitment, retention and inspiration of the next generation of airmen.
