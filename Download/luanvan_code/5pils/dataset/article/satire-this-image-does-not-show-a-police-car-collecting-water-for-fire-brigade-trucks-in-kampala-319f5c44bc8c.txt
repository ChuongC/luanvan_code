A Facebook post claiming to show an image of a police car collecting water for the fire brigade trucks at a bomb scene in Kampala is SATIRICAL.
A photo of a police branded vehicle that had veered into an open drainage is attached with a text that reads, “A police car collecting water for the fire brigade trucks at the bomb scene in Kampala. Courtesy picture.”
However, police spokesperson Fred Enanga says that as much as the image was taken in Uganda, the claim that the car was collecting water for the fire brigade is false.
“Of course this is fake,” Enanga told PesaCheck in an interview.
Uganda has several experienced terror attacks between October and November 2021. For instance, six people were reported dead and several others injured following a twin suicide bomb attack in Kampala’s central business district on 16 November 2021. While police say rebel group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) is behind the attack, Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility.
This is in addition to previous attacks reported in other parts of the country in October 2021.
Also, a Google reverse image search reveals that the image was used online before the Kampala bomb incident. The photo has been used online since 2016, as seen here, here, here and here.
