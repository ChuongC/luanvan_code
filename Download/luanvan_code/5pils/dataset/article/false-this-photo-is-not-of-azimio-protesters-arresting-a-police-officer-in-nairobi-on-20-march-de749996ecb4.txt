This photo shared on Facebook and Twitter purportedly of a police officer arrested by protesters during the 20 March 2023 Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya mass action in Nairobi is FALSE.
The photo features a uniformed officer being marched towards a car by people in civilian clothes.
The accompanying text reads: “VINDU VICHENJANGA (things change) Situation turn opposite as Azimio protesters choose to arrest police officers during #Maandamano in Nairobi cbd.”
A section of Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya supporters took to the streets on 20 March 2023 to protest, among others, the high cost of living in the country.
The protesters engaged police in running battles across the city, with media reports indicating that some demonstrators were arrested.
But does the image show Azimio protesters arresting a police officer?
PesaCheck performed a Google reverse image search and established that the photo was taken in Kilgoris in August 2022.
According to a story published by Tuko.co.ke, the officer was arrested on claims of engaging in electoral malpractice during Kenya’s 9 August 2022 general election.
PesaCheck has examined a photo on Facebook and Twitter purportedly of a police officer arrested by protesters during the 20 March 2023 Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya mass action in Nairobi and finds it to be FALSE.
