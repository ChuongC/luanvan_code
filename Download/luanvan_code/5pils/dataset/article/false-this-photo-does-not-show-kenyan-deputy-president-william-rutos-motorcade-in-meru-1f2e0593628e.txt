A photo shared on Twitter claiming to show Kenya’s Deputy President William Ruto on the campaign trail in Meru County is FALSE.
The photo, which has also been shared on Facebook, shows a motorcade with crowds gathered on both sides of the road.
However, a reverse image search shows that the photo has been frozen from a YouTube video shared on October 4, 2013. The same clip has been shared on Khatrimaza TV YouTube channel.
The text on the clip is written in Vietnamese and its translation shows that it was taken in Hanoi, Vietnam.
The video was taken during a farewell ceremony for Vietnamese war hero General Vo Nguyen Giap. The photo shows tens of thousands of people lining up to say farewell to the fallen hero who led the country to victories over the French and the Americans.
General Giap, who died on October 4, 2013 aged 102, was revered in Vietnam because he used his charisma and tactical skills to transform a tiny band of Vietnamese guerrillas into an army that defeated the Americans and French.
PesaCheck has looked into a photograph claiming to show DP William Ruto’s motorcade on a campaign trail in Meru on October 17 and finds it to be FALSE.
