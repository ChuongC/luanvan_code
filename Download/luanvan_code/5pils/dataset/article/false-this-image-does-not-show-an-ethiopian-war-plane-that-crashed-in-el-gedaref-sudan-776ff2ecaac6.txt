An image in a Facebook post with the claim that the photo shows an Ethiopian fighter jet that crashed at El-Gedaref, Sudan, is FALSE.
Border tensions between Ethiopia and neighbouring Sudan have escalated in recent weeks. Ethiopia, which has experienced conflict in the Tigray region, has accused Sudan of taking advantage of the ongoing trouble to seize territory disputed by both countries.
After weeks of intermittent clashes, Sudan declared full control of border territory settled by Ethiopian farmers. Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs says Ethiopian fighter jets crossed into Sudanese airspace, which will escalate the tensions over the disputed al-Fashaga area.
However, a reverse image search reveals that the picture does not show Ethiopia’s warplane that crashed in El-Gedaref. Instead, the image shows a Pakistan military helicopter which had gone out on a rescue mission and crashed in the country’s mountainous northern region, causing the death of four people on board, including the pilot, his co-pilot and two soldiers.
PesaCheck has looked into a post claiming to show an Ethiopian fighter jet that crashed at El- Gedaref, Sudan, and finds it to be FALSE.
