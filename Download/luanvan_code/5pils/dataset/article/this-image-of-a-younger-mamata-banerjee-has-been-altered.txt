A photo collage of two images of Mamata Banerjee is being compared in a post that has gone viral on social media, claiming to compare an older and younger Mamata Banerjee. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo collage comparing an older and younger Mamata Banerjee.
Fact: The image of Mamata Banerjee on the left is from the early 1970s and has been altered to make it look like in the viral image. The second image on the right is from 2015 when Mamata Banerjee was seen dragging the Lord Jagannath chariot alongside actor Koel Mallick during a Rathyatra. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
A comparable image was found in an article when a reverse image search was performed on the first image (left). The image in the article, however, is not the same as the viral image. The article featured several photos of Mamata Banerjee taken throughout her political career, including this one from the early 1970s (when she was younger).
The image of Mamata Banerjee in the article is close to the viral image, except it lacks the same brightness and lipstick. An original image of Mamata Banerjee had been altered and made viral, as can be seen.
The second image (on the right) was taken in 2015 during a Rathyatra in Kolkata, when Mamata Banerjee was pulling the Lord Jagannath chariot, along with the actor Koel Mallick.
To sum it up, this image of a younger Mamata Banerjee has been altered.
