A photo of Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone is being shared on social media claiming that Deepika thrashed both the BJP Government and Modi backed media by taking a stand in support of farmers. In the photo, Deepika Padukone is seen in a t-shirt with the slogan ‘I STAND WITH INDIAN FARMERS’ on it. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Deepika Padukone in a t-shirt with ‘I STAND WITH INDIAN FARMERS’ slogan written on it.Fact: The slogan ‘I STAND WITH INDIAN FARMERS’ on Deepika Padukone’s t-shirt is photoshopped. In the original photo, Deepika is seen in just a plain black t-shirt. No slogan in support of farmers is written on it. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search, the original photo was found in an article published by ‘The Indian Express’ news website on ‘20 March 2018’. In the original photo, Deepika Padukone is seen in a plain black t-shirt with nothing written on it. This photo was shot while Deepika Padukone was coming out of the Airport.
The same photo can also be seen in an article published by ‘idiva’ website on ‘17 March 2018’. This photo is an old one and has nothing to do with the ongoing protests of farmers against the three Agriculture Bills passed by the Government of India in Parliament.
To sum it up, Deepika Padukone’s picture in a t-shirt with pro farmers message is photoshopped.
