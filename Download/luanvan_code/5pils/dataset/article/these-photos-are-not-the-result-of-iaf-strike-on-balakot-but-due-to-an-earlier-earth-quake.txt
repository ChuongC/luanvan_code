Few photos are being shared on Facebook as the bodies of terrorists killed and the debris of the building involved in the IAF strike on JeM training camp at Balakot. Let us ascertain the veracity of these pictures.

Claim: Photos of dead bodies of  terrorists and building debris due to IAF strike on JeM training camp at Balakot
Fact: The pictures being claimed as the dead bodies of terrorists and building debris struck by IAF jets are actually the images captured at the time of an deadly earth quake in the same place in the year 2005. Hence the claim is FALSE. The earthquake hit Azad Kashmir and Northen Pakistan then.
 
A reverse image search on the photos show that the pictures being claimed as the dead bodies of terrorists and building struck by IAF jets are actually the images captured at the time of an deadly earth quake that hit Azad Kashmir and Northen Pakistan in the year 2005 and reportedly claiming 80,000 people and injuring about 1,00,000 persons. The original  pictures can be found on gettyimages website as well here and here.

Finally, the photos posted on Facebook as the outcome of  Indian Air Force attack are actually those taken in the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake. Hence the claim is false.
A great believer in democracy, Bharath is convinced that the citizens of this country have a huge role to play in making it successful and effective. But he observes that with misinformation taking centre stage in the socio-political discourse, the very foundation of democracy is at threat. The shared belief that every citizen has the right to factual information without bias is what made Bharath associate with Factly since its inception. He heads Operations and Fact-checking projects at Factly.
