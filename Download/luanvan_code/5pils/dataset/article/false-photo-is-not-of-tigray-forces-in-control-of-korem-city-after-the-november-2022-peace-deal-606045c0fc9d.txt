This Facebook post with an image allegedly of Tigray troops in control of Korem city after the November 2022 peace deal between the Ethiopian federal government and Tigray forces is FALSE.
The post, in Amharic, translates to; “TPLF militants who deviated from the agreement took control of Korem city.” TPLF is the short form of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front that administers the Tigray region.
To advance the claim, an article with the image under investigation is attached to the post. The article is about a TPLF attack on Korem and Maychu cities. Further, it claims the TPLF has taken control of Korem city and that it planned to drag the people of Tigray into war again.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the picture is old and it was shared on this website along with other images on 24 June 2021, before the peace agreement.
The photo was at the time used alongside an article titled, “Tigray Defence Forces (TDF) freedom fighters”. It is the same picture that was posted on the TPLF’s verified Facebook page on 14 May 2021.
The two-year war in parts of northern Ethiopia stopped in November 2022 after the federal government and the Tigray forces signed an African Union-led peace agreement in South Africa. In addition, some services such as electricity were restored.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image apparently of Tigray fighters controlling Korem city after the November 2022 peace deal between the federal government of Ethiopia and Tigray forces and found it to be FALSE.
