An image shared on Facebook claiming to show residents of Nyando, Kisumu County, stranded after raging floods swept away a bridge is FALSE.
The photo shows two vehicles partially submerged in a fast flowing river. A long line of vehicles and onlookers is seen in the background.
The post accompanying the image states that constituents of the area represented by member of parliament Jared Odoyo are suffering while he flaunts his eloquence on national TV.
A Google reverse image search brings up the photo published alongside a number of news articles. One of the articles is by The Star, a Kenyan newspaper, and is dated May 11, 2021. The caption states that the picture was taken in Kodada market in Homa Bay County and not Nyando constituency in Kisumu County. The image is credited to the publicationâ€™s photographer, Robert Omollo.
Another article by the same publication dated September 28, 2019, explains that the bridge was swept away by floodwaters, paralysing transportation along the Kisumu-Kisii highway on which the bridge is situated.
PesaCheck has looked into the image shared on Facebook claiming to show stranded constituents in Nyando after raging floods swept away a bridge, and finds it to be FALSE.
