A Facebook post with an image claiming to show the bodies of Italian doctors who have died after contracting COVID-19 is FALSE.
The post that was shared on March 25 claims that the bodies are of some of the doctors who died in Italy on March 24.
Italy has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths at 6,820 as of March 25. According to media reports, the country recorded 743 new deaths from the pandemic on March 24.
While there have been reports of doctors contracting and dying from COVID-19, the claim that 200 doctors in Italy died in one day from the disease is also false.
A reverse image search of the photo shows that it is a scene from “Wishin’ and Hopin’”, the 14th episode on the 3rd season of Grey’s Anatomy.
The image was taken from a scene where the doctors had passed out while operating on a cancer patient who had developed ‘toxic blood’ from a mixture of herbal supplements and chemotherapy.
Data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre indicates that there are 424,048 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 18,947 deaths as of March 25.
PesaCheck has looked into a post with an image claiming to show the bodies of Italian doctors who died after contracting COVID-19 and finds it to be FALSE.
