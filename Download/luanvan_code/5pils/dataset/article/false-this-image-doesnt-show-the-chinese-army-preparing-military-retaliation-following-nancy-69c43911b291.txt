This Facebook post claiming to show the Chinese army preparing military retaliation following United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is FALSE.
Pelosi is the speaker of the US House of Representatives.
The post in the Amharic text translates as; “What will happen? It was stated that the Chinese army is on high alert to take retaliatory action. The military announced heavy military retaliation following Pelosi’s visit. US House speaker Nancy Pelosi brushed aside China’s threats and began her visit to Taiwan.”
An image that shows soldiers sitting atop military tanks is attached to the post.
However, Google reverse image search results disclose that the claim image is old and unrelated to the US official’s visit to Taiwan.
The picture was shared on the Getty Images website on 1 October 2019. The photo’s caption reads: “Chinese soldiers sit atop tanks as they drive in a parade to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, at Tiananmen Square on 1 October 2019, in Beijing, China.” Image credit is given to Kevin Frayer/Getty Images.
The same image is on other websites such as this and this.
CNN reported that Pelosi visited Taiwan despite China’s threats of retaliation. Also, BBC’s report revealed that China had fired 11 ballistic missiles in the direction of Taiwan.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post claiming to show the Chinese army ready for military retaliation following Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and finds it to be FALSE.
