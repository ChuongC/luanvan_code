This Facebook post with an image claiming to be of the Amhara victims of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) forces attack in the Arsi zone of the Oromia region is FALSE.
Part of the post in the Amharic text translates to; “It was said that the terrorist OLF Shene is still committing an attack in Arsi Jeju district. The Amharas living in the Jeju District of Arsi Zone are still confronting the brutal group and are calling for help. The massacre and persecution that has been going on non-stop for the past months in different areas of Arsi and claimed the lives of many people continued and forced citizens, especially the Amharas, to spend every minute in fear and anxiety.”
OLF Shene refers to OLA.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the photo under investigation is unrelated to the conflict in the Oromia region.
The image was shared on the Alamy website. The photo is of relatives of victims, who were attacked by the government security forces in 2005 at Zawditu hospital in Addis Ababa. It was taken on 8 June 2005 and the image credit is given to REUTERS/Andrew Heavens AH/RSS/CN.
The same picture was published on this website in 2005.
But as seen here and here, the war between OLA and the federal government of Ethiopia in the Oromia region is raging.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to be of the Amhara ethnic victims, who were attacked by the Oromo Liberation Army forces in the Arsi zone of the Oromia region, and found it to be FALSE.
