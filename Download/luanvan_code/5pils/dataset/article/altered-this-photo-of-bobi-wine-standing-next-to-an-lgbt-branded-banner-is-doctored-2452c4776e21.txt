This Facebook post with an image of Ugandan opposition party leader Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, standing next to an LGBT-branded banner is ALTERED.
LGBTQ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning.
Bobi Wine leads the opposition National Unity Party.
The post contains screenshots of posts by activist Hilary Taylor, who is also an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights.
The text accompanying the screengrabs reads: “Ebisiyaga Bitabuse”, loosely translated as, “Homosexuality is now out of control”.
However, a Google reverse image search on Bobi Wine’s photo shows that it is altered. The original image was taken in February 2022 during the S&D 5th annual Africa Week Conference at the European Parliament in Brussels.
Also, the post shares a photo of Taylor and claims that it is Frank Mugisha, the executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image of opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, standing next to an LGBTQ-branded banner and finds it ALTERED.
