A Facebook post claiming that this image shows Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) troops moving towards the Eritrean border is FALSE.
“The TPLF has moved a large number of its troops closer to the Eritrean border. Realising this, the Eritrean army was ordered to make its infantry and mechanised troops alert about the situation. Eritrea’s Army Chief, General Ephraim Sibhat, has issued a stern warning to the army, saying that there will be no such thing as mercy if a desperate TPLF group will fire at them,” the post in Amharic says.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the claim is inaccurate. The photo shows Eritrea’s military parade in 2019, according to its description on the Al Mayadeen website.
The same image was shared on Asmarino and Eritrea Hub websites on 6 August 2019, as seen here and here.
TPLF and the Ethiopian national army have, with their allies, engaged in an armed conflict in the north of Ethiopia since November 2020. According to media reports, Eritrea confirmed the involvement of its troops in the neighbouring country.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show TPLF troops moving towards the Eritrean border and found it to be FALSE.
