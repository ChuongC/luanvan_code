An image of a Shivalinga is being shared on Facebook with a claim that it was unearthed during the excavations for Ram temple construction at Ayodhya. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of a Shivalinga unearthed during the excavations for Ram temple construction at Ayodhya. 
Fact: During the excavation at Ayodhya Ram temple construction site, the remains of ancient temples such as pillars, idols of deities and a Shivalinga were found. But the Shivalinga in the image is not the one found during that excavation. The Shivalinga in the image can be found in an article published in 2016 and is related to a temple in Farrukhabad (Uttar Pradesh). So, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.    
When the image in the post is subjected to reverse image search technique, it was found in an article of ‘Amar Ujala’ which was published in 2016. As per this article, the Shivalinga in the image is related to a temple in Farrukhabad (Uttar Pradesh).
It is true that during the recent excavations at Ayodhya Ram temple construction site, the remains of ancient temples such as pillars, idols of deities and a Shivalinga were found. The reports published by various newspapers regarding this can be seen here, here and here.
To sum it up, the Shivalinga in the image was not unearthed during the recent excavations for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya.
