A Facebook post with an image allegedly showing President-elect William Ruto’s motorcade is FALSE.
“President elect Dr William Ruto hits the road with full presidential motorcade, jealousy will consume the opaque lebels [sic],” reads the post.
The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) declared Ruto as president-elect and Rigathi Gachagua as deputy president-elect on 15 August 2022.
The Assumption of the Office of President Act states that the security detail of the two V.I.P.s should be enhanced after the official announcement.
The Presidential Escort Unit is mandated to provide security to the President, the first family, the Deputy President, retired presidents, visiting Heads of State and Governments and any other V.I.P. as may be directed by the Inspector-General of Police.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image in question is an old one of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s motorcade.
The image was shared by State House Kenya in a tweet dated 12 December 2021.
The tweet reads in part: “His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta’s motorcade departs State House, Nairobi for Uhuru Gardens where the Head of State will lead the nation in marking the 57th Jamhuri Day celebrations.”
“The Head of State is accompanied by Her Excellency First Lady Margaret Kenyatta,” the tweet adds.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show President-elect William Ruto’s motorcade and finds it to be FALSE.
