An image with a photo of a man leaning stylishly on a car with the accompanying text ‘Ray before Bond! 1953’ is being shared widely on Facebook. The claim is that the man seen in the photo is Satyajit Ray and it was photographed in 1953. Let’s try to check the claim.
Claim: Image of Satyajit Ray in 1953.
Fact: The image shows Actor Sean Connery who posed as James Bond in the film ‘Goldfinger’ in 1964. So, the claim is FALSE.   
When the image in the post is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, a link of ‘Getty Images’ was obtained in the search results. It had a similar image in it and when compared that with the photo in the post, it can be found that both the images are the same except for the face of the person in them. In the ‘Getty Images’, the following description was seen about the image- ‘Actor Sean Connery poses as James Bond next to his Aston Martin DB5 in a scene from the United Artists release ‘Goldfinger’ in 1964 Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images’. So, the image in the post is a photoshopped one.
To conclude, the image of Satyajit Ray in the post is photoshopped.
