A Facebook post claiming to show newborn babies sleeping on plastic chairs at the Pumwani Maternity Hospital in Nairobi is FALSE.
A reverse image search shows that the photograph was taken at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in Kawempe Hospital in Kampala, Uganda in August 2019, and was used by several publications including The Daily Monitor, the Observer, and the New Vision highlighting overcrowding at the hospital’s neonatal unit.
Uganda’s Ministry of Health also released a statement confirming that the photos were taken at Kawempe Hospital, and attributed the situation to overcrowding at the facility as a result of referrals from medical facilities across the country, with an estimated 80–100 babies delivered at the facility daily.
The statement adds that the facility would be expanded to accommodate the high number of patients and more neonatal intensive care unit equipment had been procured.
PesaCheck has looked into the images claiming to show newborn born babies sleeping on plastic chairs at the Pumwani Maternity Hospital and finds it to be FALSE.
