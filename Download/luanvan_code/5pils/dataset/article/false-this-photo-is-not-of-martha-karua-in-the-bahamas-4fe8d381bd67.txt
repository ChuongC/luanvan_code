A Facebook post with a photo purportedly of Narc-Kenya Party leader Martha Karua enjoying life in the Bahamas is FALSE.
Shared online on 15 December 2022, the photo is accompanied by a text that reads: “Martha Karua enjoying life in the Bahamas and us we are here being told to go and demonstrate.”
Karua is a member of the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya coalition, which in November 2022, called for public forums to deliberate on a tribunal formed to investigate four Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) commissioners, who disowned Kenya’s 2022 presidential election results.
But is the photo really of Karua in the Bahamas?
Our reverse image search results established that the photo was taken in Kenya on 12 December 2022.
According to an article published by Tuko.co.ke, the politician was photographed enjoying a boat ride at the Kenyan Coast.
We checked Karua’s Instagram page where she publishes such events and found that she posted the photo on 12 December 2022.
The location tab on her post indicates that the photo was taken in Kenya and not in the Bahamas.
PesaCheck has investigated a photo shared on Facebook purporting to be of Narc-Kenya Party leader Martha Karua enjoying life in the Bahamas and finds it to be FALSE.
