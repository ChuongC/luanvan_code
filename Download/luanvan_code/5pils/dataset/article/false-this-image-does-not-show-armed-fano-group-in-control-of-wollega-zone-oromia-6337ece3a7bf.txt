A Facebook image claiming to show the Fano, an Amhara ethnic informal armed group, controlling the Wollega zone in Oromia, Ethiopia is FALSE.
The Amharic post translates, “Breaking: the Amhara People’s Force Fano, which is led by the heroic patriot Zemene Kassie, has taken full control of Wollega and is moving towards Shoa”.
Wollega is one of the provinces in Oromia and it is located in Western Ethiopia.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo shows the Amhara People’s Forces called Fano at a graduation ceremony.
The image was taken from a news report posted on the Awud Media YouTube Channel on 13 February 2022. The video is titled, “Today’s amazing Marawi Fano’s graduation ceremony at Marawi town and patriot Zemene Kassie, is attending the ceremony.” The image can be seen in several frames from minute 1:31.
Different YouTube channels covered the Fano graduation ceremony at Merawi town, as seen here and here.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show that the Fano armed group fully controls the Wollega zone of the Oromia region and finds it to be FALSE.
