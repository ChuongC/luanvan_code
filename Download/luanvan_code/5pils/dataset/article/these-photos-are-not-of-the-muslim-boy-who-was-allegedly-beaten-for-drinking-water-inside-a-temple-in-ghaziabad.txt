Few photos of a boy with injury marks are being widely shared on social media with a claim that they show the Muslim boy who was allegedly beaten for drinking water inside a temple in Ghaziabad. The incident reportedly took place near Dasna Devi Mandir in Ghaziabad. Letâ€™s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photos of a Muslim boy who was allegedly beaten for drinking water inside a temple in Ghaziabad.
Fact: The posted photos are old. They are being shared on the internet at least since October 2020. So, the posted photos are not related to the recent incident in Ghaziabad. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photos were run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photos were found to be uploaded by some social media users back in October 2020.
Also, several news websites have reported in October 2020 that the child in the photos was beaten by his father and the incident took place in Al Mahwit Governorate (Yemen). Some news reports on the incident can be read here and here. FACTLY could not independently verify the location & context of this incident. But, as the photos are old, it can be concluded that the posted photos are not related to the recent incident in Ghaziabad.
The visuals related to the Ghaziabad incident can be seen here and here. Ghaziabad Police have tweeted that the accused in the case have been arrested.
To sum it up, the posted photos are not related to the Muslim boy who was allegedly beaten for drinking water inside a temple in Ghaziabad.
