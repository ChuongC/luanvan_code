A post on Facebook with an image showing an advanced road network with a claim it was taken in Rubirizi district, western Uganda, is FALSE.
The post claims that the image was taken in a part of Rubirizi that the media does not show the public.
“This is the part of Rubirizi the media doesn’t show you. Around there (sic) when you are almost reaching the first roundabout from Rutoto”.
Rubirizi is a district in western Uganda with nine sub-counties, including Rutoto in Bunyaruguru county. Natural forests make up the main physical features in Rubirizi district.
However, an image search on Shutterstock, a global provider of stock photography, reveals that it was taken in Seoul, South Korea in August 2019, by Nghia Khanh.
PesaCheck has looked into a post with an image showing an advanced road network with a claim it was taken in Rubirizi district, western Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
