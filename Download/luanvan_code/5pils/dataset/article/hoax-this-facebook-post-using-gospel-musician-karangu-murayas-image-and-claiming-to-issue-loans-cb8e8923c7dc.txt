This Facebook post using the image of gospel musician Karangu Muraya and claiming to issue loans is a HOAX.
The post also purports to offer an opportunity for prospective investors to join an investor group by making an initial deposit of KSh5,000.
“To join our investor group deposit Kshs. 5,000 refudable (Sic) Get loan kshs 70,000 within 20 minutes without guarantor Whatsapp Our Secretary 0795217639,” reads the post.
By using Muraya’s image, the post creates the impression that he is either part of the purported investor group or has endorsed it.
We checked Muraya’s verified Facebook page for any such investor group and loans, but there were none.
The image used in the post under investigation was published on Muraya’s Facebook page on 20 October 2023, as he was marketing an event he was set to attend in Nanyuki, Kenya.
On 21 October 2023, the Kenyan gospel musician distanced himself from the post in question and urged Kenyans to disregard it.
“Caution! Mimi hakuna kitu kama hii najua.Usikubali kuconiwa. (Caution, I don’t know anything about this, don’t accept to be conned),” Muraya posted.
PesaCheck looked into a Facebook post using the image of gospel musician Karangu Muraya and claiming to issue loans and found it to be a HOAX.
