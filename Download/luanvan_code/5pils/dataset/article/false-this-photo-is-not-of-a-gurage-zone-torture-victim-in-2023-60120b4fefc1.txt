This Facebook post with an image purportedly of a Gurage zone torture victim in 2023 is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by Amharic text that translates to; “I would not be surprised if I was beaten more than this for my identity. Justice for [ethnic] Gurage. Release the imprisoned.”
The picture was also posted on this Facebook account alongside a text in Amharic that translates to; “Wallahi, our issue will make you cry. But why? They didn’t steal or kill people or didn’t terrorize the country. All this violence and all these beatings are just because they requested the law to be respected.”
However, Google and TinEye reverse image search results established that the claimed image is not of a torture victim from the Gurage zone in 2023.
As seen here and here, the image was shared on different Twitter accounts in 2019. The tweets indicated the image is of a domestic violence victim.
The claim under investigation was made against the backdrop of a February 2023 protest in Wolkite city, the administrative capital of Gurage zone in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples region, over the water crisis. Reports indicate that at least three people were killed and several others injured in the protests.
PesaCheck has examined a Facebook post with an image purportedly of a Gurage zone torture victim in 2023 and found it to be FALSE.
