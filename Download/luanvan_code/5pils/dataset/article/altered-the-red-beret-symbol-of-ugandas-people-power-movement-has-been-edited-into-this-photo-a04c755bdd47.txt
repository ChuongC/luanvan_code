An image shared in a Facebook post showing Tanzanian bongo flava singer, Diamond Platinumz, clad in a People Power beret has been ALTERED.
The image is posted alongside a congratulatory message to the artist for winning the Afrima Award 2020.
The branded red berets and red overalls are symbolic of the political activism of People Power, a Ugandan pressure group led by presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine.
However, in September 2019, the Ugandan government designated the red beret official military clothing and members of the public who wear them can be jailed.
Further, the image of the bongo musician wearing a People Power branded beret is altered. A Google reverse image search shows the original photo which was featured by a blog called Sharon Madonna and Pulse Live. The original photo shows the singer clad in the same pinstripe suit and multicolour tie, wearing his hair in cornrows and with no headgear.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared in a Facebook post showing Tanzanian bongo flava singer, Diamond Platnumz, wearing a People Power beret and finds it to have been ALTERED.
