A Facebook post showing an image of a KSh6,000 banknote with Raila Odinga’s face is SATIRICAL.
The post in Swahili reads; “Tushaanza kupata mshahara ya Baba the 5th [We have already started getting Baba the 5th’s salary].
Baba is a moniker used to refer to the 2022 Azimio la Umoja — One Kenya coalition presidential candidate, Raila Odinga.
The claim was also shared here.
Odinga vied for the presidential position in the 9 August 2022 Kenyan polls, alongside Martha Karua as his running mate. Part of their manifesto is to implement — if elected into office — a KSh6,000 monthly social protection programme to cushion families living below the poverty line.
The highest banknote denomination in Kenya is 1000. The image in the claim mimics the new generation currency notes unveiled by the CBK in 2019.
Furthermore, only the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has the authority to print money or introduce new denomination banknotes.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post showing an image of a KSh6,000 note with Raila Odinga’s face and finds it to be SATIRICAL.
