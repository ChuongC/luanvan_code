A Facebook post is being shared using the photo of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs of India Kiren Rijiju, congratulating him for being elected as MP again in 2019. Let’s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.
The archived version of the post can be found here.
Claim: Union Minister of State for Home Affairs of India Kiren Rijiju has been re-elected as Member of Parliament from Arunachal Pradesh
Fact: The photo in the post is the one taken in the context of Kiren Rijiju’s filing of nomination papers with the Returning Officer for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections 2019. Hence the claim made in the post stands FALSE.
The photo used in the Facebook post can be found in Kiren Rijiju’s tweet dated March 25, 2019. In it, he wrote, “Filed my nomination papers before the Returning Officer for Lok Sabha election at Aalo for 1-Arunachal West Parliamentary Constituency”. Hence the photo in the post is the one taken in the context of Kiren Rijiju’s filing of nomination papers with the Returning Officer for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections 2019.Lastly, Kiren Rijiju has just filed his nomination papers for the upcoming Lok Sabha General elections-2019 and he hasn’t been elected as Member of Parliament yet.
