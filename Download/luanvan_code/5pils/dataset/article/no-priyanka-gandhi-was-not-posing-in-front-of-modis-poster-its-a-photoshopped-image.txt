A post with an image of Priyanka Gandhi in front of PM Modi’s poster is being shared on Facebook by many users. Let’s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.
Claim: Priyanka poses with the victory symbol in front of the Modi’s poster.
Fact: The image has been photoshopped. Priyanka’s head has been placed over some other woman’s head. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When Priyanka’s face in the image is cropped and ran through Google Reverse Image Search, a Huffing Post article with the same image is found in the search results. The face of Priyanka has been taken from the image in the article and was placed on someone else in the posted photo. The identity of the person and the source of the original photo was not found on the internet. So, the photo posted on Facebook is photoshopped.
To sum it up, Priyanka Gandhi was not posing in front of Modi’s poster. It’s a photoshopped image.
