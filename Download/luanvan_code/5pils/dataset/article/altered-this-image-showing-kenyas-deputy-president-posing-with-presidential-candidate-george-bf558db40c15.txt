An image shared on Facebook showing Deputy President, William Ruto, posing with Roots Party presidential candidate, Prof George Wajackoyah, is ALTERED.
The image shows the DP, who is also a presidential candidate under the United Democratic Alliance (UDA), shaking hands with Wajackoyah outside an unidentified building.
The Facebook post accompanying the image indicates that Ruto has endorsed the professor’s presidential bid.
An endorsement of Wajackoyah by the DP would have received wall-to-wall coverage in the media. However, an internet search shows no credible news organisation has published such a story.
A reverse image search brings up a tweet by Ruto indicating that in the original image of 30 May 2022, the DP is shaking hands with Bomet Senator Christopher Langat, and not Wajackoyah as claimed.
PesaCheck has examined the image claiming to show Deputy President, William Ruto, posing with Roots Party presidential candidate, George Wajackoyah, and found it to be ALTERED.
