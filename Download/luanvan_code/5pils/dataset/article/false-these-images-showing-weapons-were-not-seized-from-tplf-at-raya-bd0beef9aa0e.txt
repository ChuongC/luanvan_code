A Facebook post with images purporting to show weapons seized by the Ethiopian Defence Force from Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) fighters in Raya is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo text accompanying the two images translates as; “Breaking: It is known that the heroic defense force has captured 430 Kalash and three Dishka by attacking the terrorist group of TPLF forces in Raya.”
The Ethiopian government forces and TPLF forces, a regional army, have since November 2020 engaged in armed conflict in the country’s northern Tigray. There was a cessation of hostilities, but fighting resumed on 24 August 2022.
However, Google reverse image search results here and here reveal that the photo shows weapons captured from the Oromo Liberation Army. The images were from the video titled; “In an operation undertaken by the defence forces and the federal police of the Oromo Liberation Army, more than 100 members of it are eliminated”.
The first image was taken from a news report posted on the Amhara Media Corporation YouTube channel on 2 February 2022. The image can be seen in several frames from minute 3:01.
The second image was also taken from a news report posted on the Amhara Media Corporation YouTube channel on 2 February 2022. The image can be seen in several frames from minute 2:52.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with images claiming to show weapons captured from Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) at the Raya area by the Ethiopian Defence Force and finds it to be FALSE.
