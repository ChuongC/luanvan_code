This Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attacking Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces in the Kamisee town is FALSE.
The text in Amharic translates, “ A Junta’s convoy gathered on the outskirts of Kamisee town was hit by Ethiopian Air Force.”
Junta is a phrase used by Ethiopian authorities to refer to the TPLF.
Kamisee is located in the Special Oromia Zone of the Amhara region.
On 4 November 2020, following months of political tensions, the Federal government of Ethiopia launched a military offensive against the region’s ruling TPLF party. The conflict has since spread to Amhara and Afar regions.
02 November 2021, the Ethiopian government declared a state of emergency, triggering more fear of instability. The United States embassy in Addis Ababa issued a travel advisory warning its citizens to avoid travel to Ethiopia.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the image has been online since it was published by a United States Department of Defence employee SRA Grel Davis, on 15 May 1999. It is labelled “Mirage 2000C in-flight 2”.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attacking TPLF forces in the Kamisee town and finds it to be FALSE.
