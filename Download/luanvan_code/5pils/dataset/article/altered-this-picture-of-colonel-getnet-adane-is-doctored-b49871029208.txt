This Facebook image depicting Col Getnet Adane as the spokesperson of the Oromo Liberation Front is ALTERED.
The picture is accompanied by a text in Amharic translated to; “Action is required.”
The photo displays an in-text image in Amharic, translating to; “Let Amhara disappear.” The picture of Col Getnet has a desk nameplate on the right that reads: “The spokesperson for the OLF.”
OLF is a legally registered opposition political party in Ethiopia. In the picture we are debunking, the party’s flag is affixed to the shoulders and cap of Col Getnet.
However, Google reverse image search results showed that the image is digitally manipulated.
The original photo was shared on the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) website on 28 June 2022.
This indicates that the OLF flag and the statement, “Let Amhara disappear”, were digitally inserted into the original image.
Col Getnet is listed as the Public Relations Director at the Ethiopian National Defense Force, whereas Lemmi Gemechu is OLF’s public relations head.
PesaCheck has examined a Facebook image depicting Colonel Getnet Adane as the Oromo Liberation Front spokesperson and found it to be ALTERED.
