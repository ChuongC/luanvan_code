This image posted on Facebook purportedly of houses belonging to the Wollo Oromo people going up in flames is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by a post in Afaan Oromo that reads: “It is the home of the Wollo Oromos that is burning. How can you say Oromo is ruling the country?”
The Wollo Oromo are an Oromo subgroup residing in northern Ethiopia.
On 24 January 2023, BBC Afaan Oromo reported that violence erupted after a disagreement between local youth and members of the Special Forces, leading to the killing of seven Oromo youth by the Special Forces. This escalated into clashes between the regional Special Forces and local residents in Jille Dhumuga, Wollo Oromia Special zone of the Amhara region.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the image is not related to houses belonging to Wollo Oromo people being destroyed by fire in January 2023.
The image was first shared on the Fana Broadcasting Corporate S.C. (FBC) verified Facebook page on 12 March 2022.
“A fire broke out in a marketplace in Kola Diba town of Central Gondar Zone, causing property damage, according to the city administration,” part of the FBC report reads.
Kola Diba is in the Amhara region.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook purportedly of houses belonging to Wollo Oromo people going up in flames and found it to be FALSE.
