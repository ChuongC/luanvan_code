A post with a photo is being widely shared on Facebook with the claim that it is a rare picture of Mahatma Gandhi’s murder by Nathuram Godse. Let’s analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim:  A rare picture of Mahatma Gandhi’s murder by Nathuram Godse.
Fact: The image is from a still of the movie ‘Nine Hours to Rama (1963)’. So, the claim is FALSE.
When the image is subjected to reverse image search technique, a link of ‘Internet Movie Database’ (IMDb) was obtained in the search results. It is related to the movie ‘Nine Hours to Rama (1963)’. The image was found in the photo gallery of that movie. The movie is about Nathuram Godse’s plan to kill Mahatma Gandhi and the task of a police officer, Gopal Das, to find the killer before it’s too late. 
The movie ‘Nine Hours to Rama’ was found on YouTube and a still in it, at 1:55:32, is similar to that of the viral photograph. 
To conclude, a still from a movie is falsely shared as ‘Rare picture of Mahatma Gandhi’s murder by Nathuram Godse’.
