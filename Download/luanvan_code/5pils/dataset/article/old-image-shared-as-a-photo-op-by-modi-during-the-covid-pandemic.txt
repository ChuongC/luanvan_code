A post with the image of PM Modi seen reading a newspaper is doing rounds on social media with a claim that Modi has opted for a photo-op in this time of crisis (COVID pandemic). Also, in the image, we can see a laptop and a couple of books lying beside Modi. Through this article let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo-op of PM Modi reading books, a newspaper in these times of COVID-19 pandemic.
Fact: The same image is featured in a listicle dated 14 September 2013 and the image is available on the internet at least since 2011. The description of this image reads ‘Gujarat Chief Minister on the lawns of his palatial home in Gandhinagar’. Thus the image is many years old. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
A reverse image search of this photo led us to a listicle dated 14 September 2013. The title of the listicle reads “30 things you should know about Narendra Modi”.
Description of this particular image in the listicle reads ‘Gujarat Chief Minister on the lawns of his palatial home in Gandhinagar’. The same picture is also available on blogs and other sources since 2011.
To sum it up, an old image is being shared as photo-op of Prime Minister Modi with books, a newspaper in these times of COVID-19 pandemic.
