This image shared in a Facebook post claiming to show Ethiopia’s Tigray regional president Debretsion Gebremichael is ALTERED.
The Amharic caption translates as; “If our country’s hero defence force continues like this, let’s meet at Mrs Detsi’s hotel for lunch tomorrow.” Detsi is a moniker for Debretsion and the claim mentioned him as a woman by saying Mrs Detsi.
As seen here and here, the same claim was shared in other Facebook groups.
To advance the claim, an image that shows a person in an attire that appears to be a dress is attached to the post. However, Google reverse image search results established that the claimed image is digitally manipulated.
The original image was shared on this website on 15 December 2020. Other websites, including this and here, published the photo.
Debretsion is the president of the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia.
The war in northern Ethiopia began in November 2020. And in March 2022, the conflicting parties agreed on cessation of hostilities. However, fighting resumed in August 2022.
PesaCheck has examined an image of a Facebook post claiming to show Tigray’s regional president Debretsion Gebremichael and finds it to be ALTERED.
