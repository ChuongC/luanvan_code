A tweet with an image claiming to be of hunger victims in the Oromia region of Ethiopia is FALSE.
“More than 10 million people are currently food-insecure & no drinking water in Oromia alone. Cholera is ravaging communities while Abiy is spending millions on Drones & lethal weapons,” the post reads.
However, results from a Google reverse image search indicated that the claimed image is not of victims of hunger in Oromia.
The photo was shared on this website on 4 August 2011. The accompanying caption reads: “A mother lies exhausted with her child on a dusty road in Mogadishu while waiting wait for medical assistance from ‘The Gift of the Givers’ at a makeshift medical camp for famine stricken Somalians in the Hawlwadag district in Mogadishu, Somalia.” Image credit is given to Antoine de Ras, The Star.
The picture has previously been debunked by PesaCheck as it was used to advance a claim in a different context.
However, an Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) report released on 13 October 2022, indicated there was an outbreak of cholera in Bale Zone, Oromia region. It was also reported that the conflict and drought in Oromia exacerbated the humanitarian crises in the region.
PesaCheck has examined the tweet with an image claiming to be of hunger victims in the Oromia region of Ethiopia and found it to be FALSE.
