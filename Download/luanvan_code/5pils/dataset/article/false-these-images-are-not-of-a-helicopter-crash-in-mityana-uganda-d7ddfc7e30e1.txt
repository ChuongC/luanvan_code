A Facebook post with images claiming to show a helicopter crash in Mityana district in Uganda is FALSE.
The post has two photos, which it claims show a helicopter crash in the Ugandan district on the evening of 26 July 2022. Four Ugandan military officers survived the crash, according to the post.
On 26 July 2022, NTV reported that four members of the Uganda Peopleâ€™s Defence Forces (UPDF) air force survived after the helicopter they were travelling in developed mechanical failure and crashed. However, the images in the post were not taken from the incident in Mityana as claimed.
A Google reverse image search done on the first photo and the second photo show that the photos were taken in August 2012 after three Ugandan helicopter gunships crashed on Mt Kenya due to bad weather.
The images were taken by photographer Peter Greste in August 2012 for the Reuters news agency and were featured in the Daily Mail and the Voice of America.
PesaCheck has looked at a Facebook post with images claiming to show a helicopter crash in Mityana district in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
