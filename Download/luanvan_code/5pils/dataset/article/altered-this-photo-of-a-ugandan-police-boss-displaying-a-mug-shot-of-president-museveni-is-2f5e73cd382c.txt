A Facebook post showing police boss Paul Lokech, with a photo of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, over text saying police have arrested a suspect in the attempted murder of General Katumba Wamala, is ALTERED.
The post, which is in Luganda, a local dialect, claims Maj Gen Lokech displayed Museveniâ€™s photo as suspect in the attempted murder of the former Chief of Defence Forces, who was appointed Works and Transport minister.
Additionally, the post urges the public to report any sighting of the suspect in the photo to the nearest police station.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the original image in the post has been removed and replaced with that of President Museveni.
The original image posted online by broadcaster NTV Uganda, shows that the photo displayed by Maj Gen Lokech is of a man the Deputy IGP Lokech identified as Hussein Lubwama, and not Mr Museveni.
On 1 July, 2021, DIGP Lokech announced that the force had made a major breakthrough, and arrested four more suspects in connection with the attempted assassination of Gen Wamala, which left his daughter and driver dead.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show Deputy Inspector General of police Paul Lokech, displaying a photo of Uganda President Yoweri Museveni, as one of the suspects in the attempted murder of General Katumba Wamala, and finds it to be ALTERED.
