A Facebook post with images purporting to show Ethiopia’s Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) preparing for the 4th round of war in November 2022 is FALSE.
“TPLF, which agreed to a peace deal with the Ethiopian government, is now preparing its forces for another war in the Raya route,” the post shared on 20 November 2022, reads in part.
“It was stated during the signing of the peace agreement that the TPLF forces are expected to disarm and return to military camp on the coming Tuesday [22 November 2022]. However, sources reveal that the TPLF forces are preparing to launch a 4th round attack. They are deploying additional forces via the Raya route,” the publication adds.
Raya is a district in the Tigray regional state.
Accompanying the post are two images, the first of armed people walking on a street, and the second of the commander of the Tigray army, General Tsadkan Gebretensae.
On 2 November 2022, the Ethiopian government and TPLF signed a peace deal in South Africa that sought to end hostilities. The military commanders of the two warring parties also signed a declaration to implement the peace deal in Nairobi, Kenya, on 12 November 2022.
However, the images we are investigating are not not of TPLF forces preparing for another round of war in Raya as claimed.
Yandex reverse image search results for the first image show TPLF fighters in Mekelle in 2021. The image is credited to AFP photographer Yasuyoshi Chiba via Getty images. It shows TPLF fighters regaining Mekelle, the capital of the Tigray region, on 29 June 2021.
Reverse image results established that the second picture is of General Tasdkan Gebretensae who, up to 2000, was chief of staff of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces. Tsadkan is the leader of Tigray forces in the two-year war against the Ethiopian government forces.
The second claim image was taken during the 1998–2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea border war. Tsadkan, as the commander of the Ethiopian army, was addressing journalists in Addis Ababa in May 2000.
PesaCheck has investigated a Facebook post with images claiming to be of TPLF fighters preparing for the 4th round of war in November 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
