A social media post shares a photo of Portugal football player Cristiano Ronaldo seeming to support the Argentinian football team. Lionel Messi’s image can be seen on a TV screen behind him. Let’s fact-check this post through this article.
Claim: A photo of Cristiano Ronaldo supporting the Argentina football team with Lionel Messi’s photo a TV Screen behind him.
Fact: This photo is a morphed version of the original picture shared by Cristiano Ronaldo on his Instagram in October 2020. Reportedly, Ronaldo was in quarantine due to COVID-19, and he shared this picture in support of his team, who were playing a game in the Nations League against Sweden. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
A reverse image search using this photo led us to a news article by ‘The Sun’. This article shared the same photograph as in the viral post, but a stadium can be seen on TV instead of Lionel Messi. The photo is captioned – ‘The Portuguese megastar is currently isolating with coronavirusCredit: Instagram / @cristiano.‘
With this hint, we looked for the same image on his Instagram and found it uploaded on 15 October 2020.

Reportedly, he tested COVID-19 positive at that time and posted this picture in support of his team, who were playing against Sweden in the Nations League (here and here ). This photo is edited and used in the viral post to make it look like he is supporting Argentina in the context of the ongoing FIFA world cup.
To sum up, this post shares an edited image to claim that Cristiano Ronaldo is supporting Argentina.
