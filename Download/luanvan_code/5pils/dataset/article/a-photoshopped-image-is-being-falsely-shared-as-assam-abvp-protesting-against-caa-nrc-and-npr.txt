A photoshopped image is being falsely shared as ‘Assam ABVP Protesting against CAA, NRC and NPR’ - FACTLY

A post with an image is being widely shared on Facebook with the claim that it shows Assam ‘Akhila Bharatiya Vidya Parishad’ (ABVP) men protesting against CAA, NRC, and NPR. Let’s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post. 
Claim: Image of ABVP men in Assam protesting against CAA and NRC by holding a flexi with the text ‘We don’t support NRC and CAA’. 
Fact: The image in the post is a photoshopped one. In the original image, Ahmedabad ABVP men are holding the flexi with the text ‘We support CAA’. So, the ABVP men in the image were actually holding a pro-CAA flexi. Hence, the claim is FALSE.   
When the image in the post is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, a link of ‘Ahmedabad Mirror’ was obtained in the search results. The article had a similar image but the ABVP men in that image were holding a banner with the text- ‘We support CAA’. From the article, it was found that ABVP members of Ahmedabad have gathered at Sabarmati Ashram to support Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). So, the claim made in the post is false.
To conclude, a photoshopped image is being falsely shared as ‘Assam ABVP Protesting against CAA, NRC and NPR’.
