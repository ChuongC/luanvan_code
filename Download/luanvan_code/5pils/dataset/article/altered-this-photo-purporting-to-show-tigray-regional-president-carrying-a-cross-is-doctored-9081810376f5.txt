A Facebook image claiming to show Ethiopian Tigray regional president, Debretsion Gebremichael carrying a cross, is ALTERED.
“You said that Satan gets angry when he sees the cross. So, this is just to say that I do not get angry when I see the cross,” part of the post in the Amharic states.
“Tigray people were first abused by their own children before they were abused by other external forces. Their political line is divisive, discriminatory, and does not accept everyone equally,” the post adds.
A photo of a man holding a cross, which the claim purports to be Debretsion, is attached to the post. But Google reverse image search results reveal that the picture is doctored.
The original picture shows an Orthodox priest. And it has been on various online platforms since 26 August 2014.
The same image was published on this website on 31 October 2016. The doctored image was created by replacing the face of the priest with that of Debretsion. The screenshot below shows the original image of Debretsion.
Currently, Debretsion is leading the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) and Tigray fighters fighting against Ethiopia’s federal government. The war in Tigray began in November 2020. However, the conflicting parties agreed to a cessation of hostility in March 2022 to allow unfettered humanitarian assistance to the region.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook image claiming to show Tigray’s President, Debretsion Gebremichael, holding a cross and found it to be ALTERED.
