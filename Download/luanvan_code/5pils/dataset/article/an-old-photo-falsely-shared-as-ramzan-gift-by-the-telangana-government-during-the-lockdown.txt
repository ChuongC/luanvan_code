A photo of a Ramzan gift kit by the Government of Telangana is being shared widely on social media with a claim that the government is giving gifts for a Muslim festival during the lockdown. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of a Ramzan gift kit given by the Telangana Government during the lockdown.
Fact: The posted image is an old one. It was found to be circulating on the internet at least since July 2015. Also, Telangana CM KCR has clarified that they are not distributing Ramzan kits this year due to COVID-19 crisis. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. 
When the posted image was run through Google Reverse Image Search, it was found that the photo is an old one. The same photo was found to be circulating on the internet at least since July 2015. A Facebook user has also posted the same photo in 2015. The photo can be also found in an article published by the ‘Sakshi Post’ in 2018. So, the photo is not related to the current Ramzan month during the lockdown.
Also, in a recent press conference on 5 May 2020, Telangana CM KCR has clarified that they are not giving Ramzan gift kits this year due to the COVID-19 crisis as distributing them may have the risk of spreading the virus. The same can be watched in the press conference video at 1:40:00. Also, it should be noted that the Telangana government has previously distributed sarees for a Hindu festival – Bathukamma and gift packs for Christmas.
To sum it up, an old photo falsely shared as ‘Ramzan gift by the Telangana Government during the lockdown’.
