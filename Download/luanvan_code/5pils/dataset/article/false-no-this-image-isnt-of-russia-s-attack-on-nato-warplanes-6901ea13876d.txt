A Facebook post with an image claiming to be of Russia attacking North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) warplanes is FALSE.
The post in Afaan Oromo translates to; “Special Information: Tonight, Ethiopia’s friend, Russia, attacked NATO’s warplanes in the air.”
NATO is an intergovernmental military alliance of 30 Western countries, among them the United States and Canada.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo used in the claim is not related to an attack on NATO warplanes.
The image was posted on the Isca News website on 16 September 2017 in an article about a Russian Sukhoi 27 plane that crashed during a test flight in Nevada, USA.
The image has previously been published online in contexts unrelated to an attack on NATO’s warplanes by Russia.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly of Russia attacking NATO warplanes and finds it to be FALSE.
