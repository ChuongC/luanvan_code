A tweet claiming to show an image of the 2021 World Rally Championship (WRC) in Kenya is FALSE.
The image shows a RedBull-branded Volkswagen car in the air, with an aeroplane flying a few inches above it. The author of the tweet claims the photo was taken during the 2021 WRC held in Naivasha, Kenya, and that photographers at the event must have overworked to capture such a shot.
“The photographers are overworking. Look at some of the authentic photos captured,” the tweet reads in part.
The image was also shared by former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.
However, a reverse image search shows that the image was not captured in Kenya, but at the Rally Sardinia, also known as Rally Italia Sardegna in 2013. The photo, taken by Andrey Fomchenkov, was initially published in the 13th issue of the Autosport Newspaper (Abto Chopt) on 27 June 2013. The magazine was initially written in Russian. Sardegna is the Italian word for Sardinia, an Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea.
Rally Italia Sardegna was the seventh round of the 2013 World Rally Championship season. It took place in Sardinia, an Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea, from June 20–22, 2013. There were 16 stages in total which covered 1,102.43 km. French duo Sébastien Ogier and Julien Ingrassia emerged winners of the competition, defeating the Belgian pair of Thierry Neuville and Nicolas Gilsoul by only one minute 16.8 seconds.
Eight years down the line, Sébastien Ogier and Julien Ingrassia scooped the first position in the 2021 WRC held in Naivasha, Kenya.
The WRC returned to Kenya for the first time in 19 years. The 18-stage race, popularly known in East Africa as the Safari Rally, is considered one of the toughest rallies in the world.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet claiming to show an image of the 2021 World Rally Championship (WRC) in Kenya and finds it to be FALSE.
