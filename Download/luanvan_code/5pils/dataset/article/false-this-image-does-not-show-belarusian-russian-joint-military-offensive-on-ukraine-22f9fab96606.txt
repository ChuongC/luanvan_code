This Facebook image claiming to show Belarusian and Russian joint military offensive on Ukraine is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by a post in Amharic that translates to, “Ukraine Under Joint Military Offensive. Belarus deploys joint forces with Russia on the Ukrainian border!!! Belarus says the joint military deployment with Russia on the border is a defensive measure. Belarus announced on Tuesday that it was deploying its army alongside Russian troops on its borders to prevent a possible attack. ‘All the activities currently taking place are aimed at providing an adequate response to the actions happening near our borders,’ the Ministry of Defense said.”
However, Google reverse image search results showed that the image under investigation is not related to Belarusian-Russian joint military offensive on Ukraine.
The picture was shared on the BBC website on 9 May 2020 with the caption, “Belarusian soldiers rehearsed in Minsk on the eve of the parade.”
