A photo is being shared on social media claiming it is a picture of a monkey flower that blooms once every 20 years in the Himalayan mountains. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo showing the monkey flower that blooms once every 20 years in the Himalayan mountains.
Fact: The image shared in the post is generated using Artificial Intelligence tools. The picture does not show a real picture of a flower in the shape of a monkey face, and it has nothing to do with the Himalayas. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, the same photo was found in an article published by the ‘mygopen’ website in June 2023. This news site reported it is a digitally created image using the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by a Toutiao page named ‘Leaf Beauty Gallery’.
When we searched for further sources of the image using this information, we found the same image published on the Toutiao page of Leaf Beauty Gallery.
The author described it as an AI painting depicting cat face flowers. The biography section of the Toutiao page clearly stated that they generate paintings using Artificial Intelligence. A few other AI-Generated paintings published on this page can be seen here and here.
The Dracula Orchids, a unique orchid family whose arrangement of columns, petals, and lip strongly resembles a monkey’s face, predominantly grows in Ecuador and Peru regions in South America. The images of Dracula orchids, also called ‘Monkey Orchids’, can be seen here, here, and here. But the image shared in the post was generated using Artificial Intelligence.
To sum it up, an AI-Generated image was shared as the picture of a monkey flower that blooms once every 20 years in the Himalayas.
