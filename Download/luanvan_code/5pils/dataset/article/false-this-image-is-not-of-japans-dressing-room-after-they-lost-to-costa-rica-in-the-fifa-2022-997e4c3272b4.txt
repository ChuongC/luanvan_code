A post with an image shared on Facebook claiming to be of Japan’s messy dressing room after losing to Costa Rica in the World Cup is FALSE.
The image has also been shared here, here and here, in reference to the Japan vs Costa Rica World Cup match played on Sunday, 27 November 2022. Costa Rica won 1–0 against Japan.
Prior to this game, the Japanese team had cleaned their dressing room spotless following their 2–1 win over Germany on 23 November 2022.
Besides, their supporters had stayed after the match to collect litter in the stadium.
So, did Japan leave their dressing room messy after losing to Costa Rica as alleged?
PesaCheck conducted a reverse image search of the image and the results show that the photo was not taken during the 2022 World Cup.
The image, which was first shared in March 2022, is the state of Italy’s dressing room after losing to North Macedonia in the World Cup Qualifiers.
The incident was also reported by Football Italia with Italy’s defender apologising for the mess on behalf of the team.
PesaCheck has looked into a post with an image shared on Facebook claiming to be of Japan’s messy dressing room after they lost to Costa Rica during the 2022 World Cup and found it to be FALSE.
