A photo of an Arjun battle tank, with an axe symbol on it, is being shared widely on social media with a claim that the Modi government is glorifying the Indian tradition in all places. The axe symbol is being claimed as the weapon of the Hindu god Parashurama. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo shows that Modi government has placed God Parashurama’s weapon axe as a symbol on Arjun Battle Tank.
Fact: The same axe symbol can be seen on the army tanks in 2013 too. So, the axe symbol is on the battle tanks before the Modi government came into power. It is a symbol of an Army division and various other symbols can be seen on different tanks. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When we searched on the internet about the axe symbol in the posted photo, it was found that such symbols on tanks represent various army divisions. Some of the symbols and their representation details can be found here, here, here, and here.
The same axe symbol, shown in the posted photo, can be also seen on the army tanks in the 2013 Republic Day parade. The photos and video related to the 2013 parade can be seen here, here, and here. So, the axe symbol is on the battle tanks even before the Modi government came into power.
Not only axe symbol, but many other symbols can also be found on various other tanks. Some of them can be seen here, here, here, and here.
To sum it up, the axe symbol in the posted photo can be also seen on the army tanks in the 2013 R-Day parade. So, it is not any recent initiative of the Modi government as mentioned in the post.
