This image shared on Twitter claiming to be of a chaotic scene at Ataye town in the Amhara region of Ethiopia in 2023 is FALSE.
The image was shared on 27 January 2023, accompanied by text that reads: “Abiy Ahmed Ali regime is burning the Amhara’s city Ataye for the fifth time. The Amhara regional government has shown complicity with Oromo’s led government. Every Amhara should defend themselves against Abiy Ahmed’s led OLA terrorist group”.
Ataye town is located in the North Shoa Zone of the Amhara region, Ethiopia.
News reports indicate a dozen civilians and combatants have been killed at Ataye town, in alleged clashes between Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) and Amhara Special Forces.

The image was shared on the Borkena website along with another photo on 26 February 2018 to support an article titled, “Nekemte protests amid a state of emergency, ‘chanted down down TPLF’”.
The description of the photo indicates it shows the protest scene in Nekemte. The image is credited to ESAT.
