A photo with some women walking on to a beach is being shared with a claim that the photo was taken in 1944 when Red Cross women landed at Normandy beach. Let’s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.
Claim: The photo shows brave women of the Red Cross arriving at Normandy Beach in 1944 to help the injured troops.
Fact:  The photo was taken in the Riviera Region of Southern France in 1945. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
When the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search, a link to the American Red Cross article can be found in the search results. According to the article, the photo was ‘taken on January 15, 1945, seven months after the D-Day Invasion at Normandy, the photo captures a United States Coast Guard-manned barge unloading its passengers onto a beach in the Riviera Region of Southern France’. The photo was not taken in 1944 but in 1945. In the post, the location of the photo was given as Normandy (Northern France) but the photo was actually taken in the Riviera region (Southern France).
The same can be corroborated by the caption attached to the image found on Getty Images.
To sum it up, the photo was taken in the Riviera region of Southern France in 1945, not at Normandy in 1944.
