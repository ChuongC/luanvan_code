A post claiming the Ethiopian Air Force has destroyed the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces at Gashena and Delanta is FALSE.
The post, written in Afaan Oromo and Amharic languages, was shared on Facebook accompanied by an image of a drone.
“The Ethiopian defense force started an attack on TPLF forces at the fronts of Gashena and Delanta,” reads the post.
Gashena and Delanta are located in the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia.
There is an ongoing armed conflict in northern Ethiopia between government troops and the TPLF forces. The war in Tigray began on 4 November 2020, after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against the region. By September 2021, the war had spread into the neighbouring regions, including Amhara, where Gashena and Delanta are located.
Google reverse image search results show that the picture used to advance the claim has been used online in a different context and is not related to the conflict in Ethiopia.
The Daily Mail on 9 March 2013, published the photo in an article. The photo’s description indicates the image shows an artist’s impression of a drone.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force destroying TPLF forces at Gashena and Delanta and finds it to be FALSE.
