A photo of Amitabh Bachchan is being shared on social media claiming it as the photo of Amitabh Bachchan shaking hands with Underworld Don Dawood Ibrahim. Let‚Äôs verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Amitabh Bachchan shaking hands with Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.
Fact: Photo shows Amitabh Bachchan shaking hands with the Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, not the Underworld Don Dawood Ibrahim. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar photo was found in a report published by ‚ÄòThe Times of India‚Äô news website on ‚Äò25 March 2010‚Äô. In the description of the photo, it is mentioned as the photo of Ashok Chavan with Amitabh Bachchan at the commissioning ceremony of Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link. Sharing the same photo, ‚ÄòOutlook India‚Äô article describes, ‚ÄòChief Minister of Maharashtra Ashok Chavan shakes hands with Amitabh Bachchan during the commissioning ceremony of the north-bound carriageway of the Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link in Mumbai‚Äô. The same photo can also be seen in an article published by ‚ÄòThe Hindu‚Äô news website.
When this photo went viral on social media recently claiming Amitabh Bachchan with Dawood Ibrahim, Abhishek Bachchan clarified in his tweet that the person along with his father is Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan.
