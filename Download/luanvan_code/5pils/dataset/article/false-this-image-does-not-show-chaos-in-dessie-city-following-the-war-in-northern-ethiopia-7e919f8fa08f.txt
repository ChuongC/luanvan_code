A Facebook image claiming to show chaos in Dessie following heavy gunfire in the city in October 2021 is FALSE.
“It is being said that the city of Dessie is in a state of turmoil. After heavy gunfire was heard near the city of Dessie last night, its residents are panicking. A resident of the city said that the whole town was in a state of shock and those who have potential were fleeing the city,” part of the post in Amharic reads.
The post includes an image claiming to show the situation in Dessie, the city that serves as capital of South Wollo Administrative Zone, located along the road to Mekelle.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo has previously been used on different online platforms.
For instance, the image was used as a cover and profile photo for a Facebook page named Dessie City Administration Urban Development and Construction Department in January 2019 almost a year before fighting began. In addition, the image can be found in a video that describes Dessie, which was uploaded to YouTube on 15 March 2019.
The war in northern Ethiopia has intensified and some cities in the Amhara region are imposing curfews. There were repeated airstrikes on the capital city of Tigray, Mekelle in October 2021, but the image used in the claim is unrelated to the conflict.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show chaos in Dessie following heavy gunfire in the city in October 2021 and finds it to be FALSE.
