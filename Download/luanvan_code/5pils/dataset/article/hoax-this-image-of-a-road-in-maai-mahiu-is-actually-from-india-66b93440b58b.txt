A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Maai Mahiu road is a HOAX.
The post states that the road is becoming dangerous because of heavy traffic, urging the government to intervene.
However, a look at the image reveals that it contains the watermark of Himanshu Khagta, an Indian photographer based in the Indian Himalayas. Additionally, a reverse image search shows that the image was taken at Zoji La, a high mountain pass in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.
Visually, the road bears some similarity with the Maai Mahiu Escarpment road in Kenya, which has been the scene of a number of severe traffic jams due to its narrowness and steep ascent.
The image was also shared on Twitter in October 2014 with a caption showing that it was on the Kargil-Srinagar road in Jammu and Kashmir, part of Indiaâ€™s National Highway 1.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that this photo shows a road in Maai Mahiu in Kenya and finds it to be a HOAX.
