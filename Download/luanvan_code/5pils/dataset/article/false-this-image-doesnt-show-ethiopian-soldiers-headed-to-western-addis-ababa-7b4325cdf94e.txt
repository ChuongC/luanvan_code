A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Ethiopian soldiers headed for battle in western Addis Ababa is FALSE.
The text accompanying the photo in Afaan Oromo translates into; “In the last few weeks, heavy fighting has been going on in Central Meta, Jeldu, Salale and other places. In the heavy battle that was going on today, the Army of Prosperity has been reduced to ashes. And that’s why Prosperity is sending its army to west Addis Ababa tonight.” the post in Afaan Oromo reads.
Prosperity Party is the ruling party in Ethiopia.
Reuters reported that in June 2022, more than 300 people were killed by the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) in Oromia.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the claim image has been online since 2013.
For instance, on 3 March 2013, the TVP Info website published the image in an article “Hurricane winds in the Canary Islands.” The caption for the picture indicates “Hurricane winds, up to 130 km per hour, paralyzed traffic on Sunday on most of the mountainous islands of the Canary Archipelago.” The image is credited to the PAP / EPA / Paris Barrera.
The photo was also published by this website on 18 June 2019 in an article, “Hurricanes and floods leave most disaster damage in Mexico.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian army going for battle in western Addis Ababa and finds it to be FALSE.
