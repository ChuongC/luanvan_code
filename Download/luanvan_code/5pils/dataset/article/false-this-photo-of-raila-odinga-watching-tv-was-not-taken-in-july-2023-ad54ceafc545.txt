This Facebook post with a photo supposedly of Azimio leader Raila Odinga watching television during the Saba Saba anti-government protests in July 2023 is FALSE.
The author claims that Odinga called for demonstrations during which protesters were teargassed as the former prime minister rested at home.
The post reads: “Raila Odinga just resting at home while sending children of hustlers to go and eat teargas at Saba Saba rallies. Akwende huko (sic).”
The photo is of Odinga watching what appears to be news on Kenyan Citizen TV. The image was shared on 7 July 2023 amid Saba Saba anti-government protests organised by the Odinga-led Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya coalition.
However, as people shared images and videos of the events unfolding during the countrywide protests, some of the images were unrelated to the Saba Saba protests, prompting our scrutiny of the photo of Odinga in the above post.
A reverse image search shows that the photo has been online since 2022. Odinga shared the photo on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook on 2 September 2022 as the opposition leader followed the Supreme Court proceedings on the disputed August 2022 presidential elections.
The photo was also shared by various news outlets, as seen here and here.
Further, according to news reports here, here, and here, Odinga led a Saba Saba rally at Kamukunji Grounds on 7 July 2023.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a photo supposedly of Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya coalition leader Raila Odinga watching TV during the Saba Saba anti-government protests and found it to be FALSE.
