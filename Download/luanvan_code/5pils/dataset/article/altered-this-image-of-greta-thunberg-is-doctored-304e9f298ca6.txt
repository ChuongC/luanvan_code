An image purportedly of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is ALTERED.
The image shows Thunberg holding a placard that states: “End weather modification programmes, climate change will stop”. It lists geoengineering, solar radiation management, and stratospheric aerosol injection as contributing to climate change and weather modification.
However, the image is altered.
A reverse image search showed the original photo, which is of Thunberg holding her signature “Skolstrejk för klimatet” sign, which means “School strike for climate”.
Thunberg embarked on a lone strike against climate change outside the Swedish Parliament in August 2018. It turned into a global youth protest movement against climate change.
The three processes on the altered placard — geoengineering, solar radiation management, and stratospheric aerosol injection — are all emerging or proposed technologies premised on mitigating climate change, not cause it.
Climate change is not caused by any of these processes. It is caused by anthropogenic global warming due to increasing emissions from greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, which has raised the temperature and is altering the climate.
Various conspiracy theories about weather modification and climate change have been previously debunked.
PesaCheck has examined an image of Greta Thunberg and finds it to be ALTERED.
