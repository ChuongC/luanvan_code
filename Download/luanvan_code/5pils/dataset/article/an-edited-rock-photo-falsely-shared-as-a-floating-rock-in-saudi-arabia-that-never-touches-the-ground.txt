An edited rock photo falsely shared as a floating rock in Saudi Arabia that never touches the ground - FACTLY

A photo is being shared on social media with a claim that it shows a rock in Saudi Arabia that is floating in the air and defying gravity. It is being claimed that the rock never touches the ground even if someone places tons of weight on it. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of a floating rock in Saudi Arabia that never touches the ground.
Fact: It is an edited photo. The rock is in Saudi Arabia but it is connected to the ground through very small pillar-like structures and appears to be floating. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When we searched regarding the rock on the internet with the keywords, many videos related to the rock were found in the search results. Those videos can be seen here, here, and here. In the videos, it can be seen that the rock is touching the ground. However, the rock is connected to the ground through very small pillar-like structures and appears to be floating. Those small pillar-like connections are edited out in the posted photo so that the rock looks completely floating in the air.
The rock is in Saudi Arabia and can be found on Google Maps with the name – ‘Floating Rock’. When the same photo went viral previously in 2019 as the floating rock in Jerusalem, ‘AFP’ has also debunked the claim.
To sum it up, an edited rock photo falsely shared as a floating rock in Saudi Arabia that never touches the ground.
