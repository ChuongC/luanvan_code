A tweet with images claiming to show recent demonstrations in Kampala, Uganda is FALSE
The tweet is accompanied by three images showing roads that have been blocked by protestors using burning tyres. The tweet was published on March 10, 2021 and similar images were also published here.
However, a Google reverse image search on the first picture shows it first surfaced online in November 2020, and was taken during unrest in Uganda that was triggered by the arrest of former presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine. The image featured in an article by the African Mirror.
A Google reverse image search for the second photo shows that it was captured in Bugembe, Jinja. The image first circulated online in November 2020, during the same protests which erupted across the country following Bobi Wine’s arrest.
The search also found a Facebook post that was published on November 18, 2020, which contains the second and third images.
On March 9, 2021, Bobi Wine called on Ugandans to “rise up peacefully and unarmed” to protest against President Yoweri Museveni’s regime. Despite Bobi Wine’s call to action, fresh demonstrations have not been held in Kampala as claimed in the post.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with images claiming to show recent demonstrations in Kampala, Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
