A Facebook image claiming to show an airstrike on Tigray People’s Liberation Front’s (TPLF) convoys at Ataye town is FALSE.
The image, shared on Facebook on 14 November 2021, shows a drone. The Amharic text accompanying the photo translates, “TPLF’s convoys on the outskirts of Ataye town were hit by the Ethiopian Air Force. More than 300 members of OLA (Oromo Liberation Army) and TPLF rebels who survived the air force attack have been arrested.”
Ataye town is located in the North Shoa Zone in Ethiopia’s Amhara region.
The conflict between TPLF and the Ethiopian central government erupted on 4 November 2020. In October 2021, the Tigrayan forces accused the Ethiopian government of launching airstrikes on Mekelle, the capital of the Tigray region.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture claiming to show an airstrike on TPLF forces at Ataye town has been used online — notably in this 2018 article on the Turkish news agency, Andolu Agency (AA) — in different contexts unrelated to the conflict. The Global Defense Corp website published it on 7 November 2020, with a description that reads “A photo of Turkish unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Bayraktar TB2 equipped with MAM-L”.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show an airstrike on the Tigray People’s Liberation Front’s (TPLF) convoys at Ataye town and finds it to be FALSE.
