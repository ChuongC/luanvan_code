A photo is being shared on social media claiming it as a picture of a giant human skeleton that was found recently during an excavation. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of a giant human skeleton.
Fact: The photo shared in the post is a digitally created image. Mzprezto, an UK-based Photoshop designer created this artwork for the project ‘PS Bonus Contest: Archaeological Anomalies 12′. It is not a real photo. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the photo, the same photo was found published on the ‘Design Crowd’ website. ‘Design Crowd’ described this image as an artwork by Mzpresto.
When we searched for further sources using relevant keywords on the internet, we found the same photo in Mzpresto’s portfolio published on the ‘Design Crowd’ website. Mzprezto is a UK-based photoshop designer. Mzpresto published this image with the title, “Photoshop Submission for ‘PS Bonus Contest: Archaeological Anomalies 12’ Contest”. The description of the photo states, “mzpresto, a British designer, created this Photoshop on 23rd October, 2008 for DesignCrowd (Community Contests), a business in Australia. The Photoshop was designed for the project ‘PS Bonus Contest: Archaeological Anomalies 12’. It was awarded 3 out of 5 stars”. From all these, it can be concluded that the image shared in the post is a digital artwork, not a real picture of a giant human skeleton.
To sum it up, a digitally created artwork was falsely shared as a real picture of a giant human skeleton.
