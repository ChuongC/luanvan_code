An image shared on Facebook post of Ugandan politician Bobi Wine posing with one of the former and current United States presidents is ALTERED.
The image shows ex-President Barack Obama and incumbent Joe Biden posing with Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, dressed in a kanzu — a traditional attire in Uganda.
The same image has been used as a thumbnail on a YouTube video, along with a headline in Luganda that reads: “Bobi Wine Abazungu Kyebamukolede Kuluno Museveni Wakufa”, loosely translated as, “The Whites have done something for Bobi Wine that Museveni will feel bad about.”
However, a Google reverse image search of the photo shows that it is altered.
The image dates to 2010 when Obama was running for US president and Biden as vice president. Biden shared the same photo on Twitter in 2012.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image of Bobi Wine next to ex-US President Barack Obama and incumbent Joe Biden and finds it to have been ALTERED.
