An image shared on Twitter claiming to show a 30-acre cremation area in India is FALSE.
A wide shot of a field where vehicles and a helicopter have parked dominates the image. The field borders a forest and a fire and thick clouds of smoke are seen billowing in the background.
The text accompanying the image remarks that Kenya is allowing planes from India, despite the Indian government “burning 30 acres worth of bodies every day due to Covid-19”.
“How many bodies do you think this (sic)?” the author of the post goes on to ask.
The image is shared at a time when India is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths. The John Hopkins University records COVID-19 cases in India rose to over 18 million — the second-highest in the world after the United States.
As the death toll passed 200,000 on April 28, 2021, images by Reuters showed mass crematoriums in New Delhi, India’s capital. Funeral rights in India, a predominantly Hindu nation, generally include cremation.
However, a Google reverse image search reveals that the photo claiming to show a 30-acre cremation area in India is false. The results instead reveal that the photo was captured in January 2020, during a firestorm in Australia.
Articles about the incident include one by wesydney.com.au that credit the image to Severe Weather Australia (SWA). The platform showcases work from severe weather reporters.
A post shared on the SWA Facebook page on January 5, 2020 carries the image in question, among others, posted by one of its members named Timothy Dean, who captured the scenes of the firestorm in Batlow, New South Wales (NSW), a South Eastern Australian state.
In some instances the photo is watermarked with the name of photographer Timothy Dean while in other cases it bears no markings.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Twitter claiming to show a 30-acre cremation area in India and finds it to be FALSE.
