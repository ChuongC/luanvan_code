An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed mourning while holding an image of himself is ALTERED.
The post, which was shared on 8 May 2022, contains an image of PM Abiy holding a framed photo of himself and Amharic text that translates, “people are elevated”.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo used to advance the claim has been doctored.
The original image shows a mourner holding the photo of former Amhara president Ambachew Mekonnen during a funeral in Bahir Dar town, Amhara region, Ethiopia, on 26 June 2019. The image is credited to Reuters/Baz Ratner.
On 22 June 2019, the president of Amhara, Ambachew Mekonnen, and his adviser were shot dead in an attempted coup in the region. The state’s attorney general was wounded during the attack. The country’s army chief was also shot dead on the same day in Addis Ababa in a separate attack related to the coup attempt.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming to show Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed mourning while holding a photo of himself and finds it to be ALTERED.
