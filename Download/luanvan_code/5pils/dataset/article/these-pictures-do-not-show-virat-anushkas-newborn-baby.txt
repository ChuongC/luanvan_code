Some pictures are being shared on social media with a claim that they show Virat-Anushka’s, newborn baby. Virat Kohli has tweeted on 11 January 2020 that they have been blessed with a baby girl. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Pictures of Virat-Anushka’s newborn baby.
Fact: These pictures do not show Virat-Anushka’s, newborn baby. As on today, neither Virat Kohli nor Anushka Sharma has shared any pictures of their daughter on their social media handles. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Photo 1:
When the photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in an article published by NDTV on World Breastfeeding Week in August 2017. The photo can be also found on the ‘Getty Images’ website. In another photo, on the ‘Getty Images’ website, the face of the mother can be seen.
Photo 2:
This baby photo was found in a blog published in 2018. Other pictures of the same baby can be seen here. So, this baby is also not the daughter of Virat-Anushka.
Some news agencies have shared a photo saying it shows the feet of Virat-Anushka’s daughter. They have reported that the photo was posted by Vikas Kohli (Virat Kohli’s brother). But later, Vikas Kohli clarified that it is a random picture and not the actual picture of the baby.
The same photo can be found in an article on the ‘Yahoo’ website. The photo’s credit is given as ‘Antonio V. Oquias/shutterstock’. The photo can be found on the ‘Shutterstock’ website.
To sum it up, unrelated photos are being falsely shared as pictures of Virat-Anushka’s newborn baby.
