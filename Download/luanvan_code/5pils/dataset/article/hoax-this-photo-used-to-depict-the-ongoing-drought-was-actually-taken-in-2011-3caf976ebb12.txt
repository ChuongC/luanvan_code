A Facebook photo claiming that a malnourished man facing starvation is a victim of the ongoing drought in some parts of the country is a HOAX.
The image, which was published on 14 March 2019, is accompanied by text that reads: “This is a preview into the situation in Turkana County. Meanwhile there’s maize rotting in Uasin Gishu and there’s a government that thinks Food Security is one of its pillars! SHAME!”
It is true that Turkana County is one of the counties currently experiencing severe drought, but a reverse image search of the above photo reveals that it was taken in 2011 and used to accompany an article published on the Capital FM news website.
In 2011, a severe drought hit the Horn of Africa with Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somali being worst affected. The drought, which was said to be the worst in 60 years, forced the then President Mwai Kibaki to declare it a national emergency.
A March 2019 brief by the National Drought Management Authority shows that over 860,000 people require immediate food assistance in the 12 counties that are worst hit by the ongoing drought, with 192,800 of them being residents of Turkana County. The below- average short rains recorded in 2018 have led to an increase in the food insecure population in the country from 655,800 in August 2018 to 1,111,500 currently.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the photo shared on Facebook depicts a victim of the ongoing drought in Turkana County and finds it to be a HOAX.
