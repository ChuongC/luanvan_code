A tweet with multiple images claiming to show infrastructure development in Uganda is PARTLY FALSE.
The tweet shows four images of different infrastructural installations along with a call to vote and secure the future.
Additionally, a campaign hashtag in support of President Yoweri Museveni, a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections, is also shared in the November 13, 2020 tweet.
However, not all the images in the tweet are from Uganda as claimed in the post.
A Google reverse image search here and here shows that the first image and the third image in the tweet are photographs of sections of Lira, a city in the northern region of Uganda.
A Google reverse image search shows the second image of a stadium was taken in Equatorial Guinea. The image, featured by Competition.dz in December 2014, captures the Mongomo Stadium, which was used during the African Cup of Nations Tournament in 2015.
A Google reverse image search of the last image showing a roundabout and a developed city centre is from Equatorial Guineaâ€™s capital, Malabo, and not Uganda. The image has been featured on multiple blogs including 17QQ, Hongyuan Wealth Network and Travel 24/7 in 2017, all referencing the scene as the capital of the central African country.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with multiple images claiming to show infrastructure development in Uganda and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
