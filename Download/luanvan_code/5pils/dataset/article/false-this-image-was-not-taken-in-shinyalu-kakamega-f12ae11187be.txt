A Facebook post claiming to show an image of Shinyalu area in Kakamega County, Kenya, is FALSE.
The post adds that the media has “intentionally failed” to show that side of Kenya.
“This is Shinyalu-Kakamega, Kenya🇰🇪 but the Media will not show you!” the Facebook post states.
An image of houses built in two rows opposite each other, with a road running between them and a dense thicket behind the homes, is attached to the Facebook post.
But is the image of a neighbourhood in Shinyalu, Kakamega County?
Our Google Reverse Image search established that the picture was not taken in Kenya but in a village called Milton Abbas in Dorset County, England.
The white cottages were built in 1773 and 1780. The original village was close to the abbey. The first Earl of Dorchester, Joseph Damer, uprooted and rebuilt the village further away from the monastery. In the 19th century, 36 people lived in one of the cottages, but that has since changed and most are single dwellings rented out to one family at a time on holiday.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show an image of Shinyalu in Kakamega County, Kenya, and finds it to be FALSE.
