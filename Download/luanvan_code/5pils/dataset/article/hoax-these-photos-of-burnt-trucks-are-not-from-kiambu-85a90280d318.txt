A Facebook post claiming to show images of a lorry torched in Kiambu County while distributing relief food donated by Deputy President William Ruto is FALSE.
A Google reverse image search on the two photos showed that the images are not from Kiambu, and they are also not from the same incident.
A reverse image search of the first photo shows it was published in December 2015 alongside a news article about a suspected Al Shabaab attack in Mpeketoni in Kenya’s Lamu County. The text of the article is copied from a Reuters story on the incident.
A reverse image search of the second image shows that the lorry in the image was set on fire by Kitui residents in 2018 while transporting charcoal from Mwingi to Nairobi. This was after Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu ordered a crackdown on charcoal production in the county.
The claim on the Facebook post follows allegations that food donations distributed by DP Ruto in Kikuyu constituency in Kiambu County were not safe for human consumption.
On May 20, the deputy president distributed food donations to families in Kikuyu Constituency’s Nachu area who were reportedly affected by tough economic times resulting from measures put in place to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with photos claiming to show a lorry that was set on fire in Kiambu County while distributing COVID-19 relief food and finds it to be a HOAX.
