A photo with some wearable armour guards is being shared on social media with a claim that Islamic jihadis wear them before blowing themselves up. It is being claimed in the post that they wear these guards to “protect their penises for the 72 virgins Allah provides for them in his Islamic paradise”. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
