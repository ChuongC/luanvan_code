An image on Twitter purporting to be of Ethiopian House of Federation Speaker Agegnehu Teshager holding a photo frame of ethnic Amhara victims in Wollega is ALTERED.
The Amhara text accompanying the photo translates to; “The death of the Amhara people in Wollega — for us, a development.” The picture purports to be of Agegnehu holding images of three women, supposedly victims of the ongoing conflict in Wollega, the Oromia region.
However, a manual search on Agegnehu’s verified Facebook page showed that the image is doctored.
The original picture was shared on Agegnehu’s verified Facebook page, along with other images on 7 May 2021. It is of Agegnehu holding a photo frame of the Fasil Kenema Football Club’s logo.
In addition, as seen here and here, images of the women in the photo frame and associated with the victims of the ongoing conflict in Wollega were previously debunked by PesaCheck.
Agegnehu was appointed the Speaker of the House of Federation in 2021.
PesaCheck has examined the image shared on Twitter purporting to be of Ethiopian House of Federation Speaker Agegnehu Teshager holding a photo frame said to be of Amhara victims in Wollega and found it to be ALTERED.
