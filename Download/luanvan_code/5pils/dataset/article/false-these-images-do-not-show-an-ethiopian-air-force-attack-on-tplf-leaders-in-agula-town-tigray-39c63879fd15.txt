This Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attacking Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) leaders in the town of Agula is FALSE.
“Breaking news: The Ethiopian Air Force took action against the leaders of the TPLF who were trying to escape in the town of Agula, which is located between Mekelle and Wukro. The force also destroyed a tank,” the post in Afaan Oromo says.
Agula is in the Debubawi Zone of the Tigray Region, northern Ethiopia.
The conflict in northern Ethiopia between government forces and Tigrayan fighters resumed on 24 August 2022, scuttling a five-month ceasefire.
However, the photos used to advance the claim are false. Reverse image search results here and here show that the pictures are not related to the conflict in Ethiopia.
The Sofrep website published the first image on 22 August 2022, alongside an article titled, “Ukrainians Blow Multiple Russian Su-35 Fighter Jets Out of the Sky.” The caption indicates the picture is of the Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-35 fighter with the photo credit given as Anna Zvereva from Tallinn, Estonia.
The second image is of a tank allegedly belonging to the Eritrean army abandoned along the road in Dansa, southwest of Mekelle in the Tigray region, on 20 June 2021. The image is credited to Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP via Getty Images.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attacking TPLF leaders in the Tigrayan town of Agula and finds it to be FALSE.
