A photo shared on Twitter purporting to be of Kenya Power and Lighting Company’s (KPLC) new logo is SATIRICAL.
KPLC is licensed to distribute electricity to consumers across the country.
The account ‘KPLC new logo’ published the 2 November 2022 tweet, with the catch phrase, “Sisi Ndio Tuko”, that loosely translates to: “We are the available options”.
On 2 November 2022, some parts of Kenya — Nairobi, Mt Kenya and the Coast — experienced a power outage that lasted several hours.
Netizens expressed their views about KPLC, turning the company into a trending subject on social media.
The claim we are debunking was one of the posts under the trending subject, ‘Kenya Power’.
We did a keyword search on Google to find out if KPLC had changed its logo and established that the power distributor had not done so.
The first search result featured the company’s logo as it appears on its official website.
We also checked Kenya Power’s Facebook and Twitter pages and found official documents using a different logo from the one we are debunking.
Unlike the photo we are debunking, KPLC’s logo is on a white background and does not have a catch phrase beneath it.
Additionally, a keyword search for the phrase “KPLC sisi ndio tuko” provided results indicating that the photo we are debunking was sourced from a satirical post published on Twitter and Instagram in May 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared on Twitter purporting to be of Kenya Power and Lighting Company’s (KPLC) new logo and finds it to be SATIRICAL.
