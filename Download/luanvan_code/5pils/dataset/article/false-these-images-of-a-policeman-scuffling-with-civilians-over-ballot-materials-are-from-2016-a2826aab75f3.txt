A tweet claiming that a policeman has been caught with a ballot box full of ticked ballot papers in favour of President Museveni is FALSE.
The tweet has two images, the first of which shows a scuffle between civilians and a man in uniform identified as a police officer. The uniformed man is holding what appears to be a black ballot box and is surrounded by a group of men, some of whom are tugging at the box while others hold his arms and shoulders.
In the second image, uniformed officers and others in civilian clothes are pictured leaving the scene aboard a dark blue pickup vehicle, leaving an open ballot box and other voting materials and debris on the ground.
However, a Google reverse image search on the first image shows that it was taken in 2016 during the general election. The image was featured in an article by the Independent, the Boston Globe and the Wall Street Journal.
A Google reverse image search of the second image shows that it was first circulated in 2016 during the presidential elections. The image was featured in an article by the VOA News and Uganda.eu.com.
None of the images shared in the tweet have anything to do with the on-going elections. Ugandans went to the polls on January 14, 2021.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet claiming that a policeman has been caught with a box full of ballot papers marked in favour of President Museveni and finds it to be FALSE.
