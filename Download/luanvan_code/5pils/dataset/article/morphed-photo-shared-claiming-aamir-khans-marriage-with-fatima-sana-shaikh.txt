A photo through a post is being widely shared on social media claiming that Aamir Khan had married Fatima Sana Shaikh. Fatima Sana Shaikh played the role of Aamir Khan’s daughter in the famous film Dangal. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo confirming the marriage of Aamir Khan with Fatima Sana Shaikh.Fact: The photo of Aamir Khan with Kiran Rao had been morphed to add Fatima Sana Shaikh. Aamir Khan with Kiran Rao were attending the engagement party of Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta in 2018. On 03 July 2021, Bollywood actor Aamir Khan and his wife Kiran Rao announced their divorce. However, there are no credible news reports which say that Aamir Khan had married Fatima Sana Shaikh, the actress who played the role of his daughter in ‘Dangal’. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.
When reverse image search is done on the photo, a similar picture was found on a website. However, the picture does not have Fatima Sana Shaikh. The picture reportedly was taken during the engagement party of Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta in 2018. The same picture can also be spotted in a YouTube video uploaded on 01 July 2018. Aamir Khan could be seen with his wife Kiran (divorced recently) in this picture.
On 03 July 2021, Bollywood actor Aamir Khan and his wife Kiran Rao announced their divorce. However, there are no credible news reports which say that Aamir Khan had married Fatima Sana Shaikh, the actress who played the role of his daughter in ‘Dangal’.
To sum it up, a 2018 photo of Aamir Khan with Kiran Rao has been morphed and is falsely shared as his marriage with Fatima Sana Shaikh.
