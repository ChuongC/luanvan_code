A Facebook image showing a man sleeping on a spring bed without a mattress, with what looks like intravenous fluid being administered, and said to be at a hospital in Uganda is MISLEADING.
The post was published on the Facebook page of Nzururu TV, with a caption saying the photo was shared by one of their followers and that it was taken from one of the Kasese hospitals.
The post, that has been reshared many times already and sparked outrage among Ugandans online, further calls upon leaders in Kasese to “take action and help their people”.
But other Facebook users refuted this claim, saying that this photo is not from the hospital.
A Google reverse search shows the image is not from Uganda and first showed up online on March 5, 2019, on Instagram, reportedly taken at a hospital in Nigeria.
The same image has also been used to make claims in various other unrelated contexts, that are false.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a photo of a man on a bare bed, apparently receiving a drip and claiming that the image was taken in one of the Kasese hospitals in Uganda, and finds it to be FALSE.
