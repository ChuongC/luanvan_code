A tweet with an image claiming to show supporters of the National Unity Platform (NUP) in Uganda destroying a road is FALSE.
The image in the tweet shows a group of people, some sitting on a road barrier, with one digging up a tarmac road using a pickaxe. The post accuses NUP supporters of destroying the roads that Ugandans are yarning (sic) for.
Additionally, the tweep wonders if the NUP party will bring peace to the country and goes on to condemn hooliganism.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image of the man digging up a road as others watch was taken in South Africa and not Uganda. The destruction happened during a protest over service delivery in eBhovini, between Pomeroy and Dundee, KwaZulu Natal in September 2020, and images of the incident were published by The Citizen.
KwaZulu-Natalâ€™s Department of Transport condemned the incident and tasked law enforcement agencies to step up their efforts to bring the culprits to book.
The image has been shared multiple times in different countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Nigeria, but fact-checks by PesaCheck, AfricaCheck, AFP Check all found that the photo was taken in South Africa.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweeted image claiming to show National Unity Platform (NUP) supporters destroying a road in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
