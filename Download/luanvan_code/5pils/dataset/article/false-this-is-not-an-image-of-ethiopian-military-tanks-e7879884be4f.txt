A Facebook image that was used to advance a claim showing tanks on the move belong to Ethiopia is FALSE.
The post in Afaan Oromo reads; “Ethiopian children return in victory and we are with you.”
More than a year of conflict in Ethiopia, Africa’s second-most populous country, has left thousands dead, forced more than two million people from their homes, and pushed parts of the country into a famine situation.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture used to advance the claim is unrelated to the conflict in Ethiopia and is not of the country’s military tanks.
The photo was posted on the Disclosure.Ninja website on 6 October 2016, in an article titled, “40 million Russians prepare for disaster or war right now!”
The UAWire news website also published the photo in an article related to Russia.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a convoy of military tanks belonging to Ethiopia and finds it to be FALSE.
