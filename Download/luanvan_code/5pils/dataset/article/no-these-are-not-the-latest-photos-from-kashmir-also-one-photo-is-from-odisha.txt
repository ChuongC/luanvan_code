A post with some images is being shared on social media with a claim that these are the latest photos from Kashmir taken after the decision by the central government to abolish Article 35A and 370. Let’s try to check whether these photos are taken recently in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
Claim: Photos are taken in Kashmir after the decision by the central government to abolish Article 35A and 370.
Fact: The photos in the post are old photos. While three photos belong to Kashmir, one photo belongs to Odisha. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
While the post does not explicitly claim that the posted photos are taken recently, the timing of the post (just after the Home Minister’s announcement in the Rajya Sabha that they are going to abolish Article 35A and 370) is making users on social media to believe that these are recent photos.
When the images in the post were run through the Google Reverse Image Search one by one, it was found that three photos in the post were old photos taken in Jammu and Kashmir whereas one photo did not belong to Jammu and Kashmir at all. It was taken in Bhadrak (Odisha) in 2017.

To sum it up, these are not the latest photos from Kashmir.

It does not matter whether it happened in Odisssa or Kashmir, it is true that Indian Terrorist Hindu Fundamentalist Modi Govt with his terrorist political parties are mass killing of Muslim minority in all parts of India. It should be stopped. Modi has previous history of killing of Muslims when he was Chief Minister.
