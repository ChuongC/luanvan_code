A Twitter post claiming to show a man-made humanitarian crisis and famine situation in the Oromia region of Ethiopia is FALSE.
The English text accompanying the image reads, “Man-made humanitarian crisis & famine in Oromia needs immediate attention before it becomes the worst human suffering of the 21st century.”
According to the World Food Programme (WFP), an estimated 13 million people in the Horn of Africa are facing severe hunger. Drought conditions have affected pastoral and farmer populations across Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia in the first quarter of 2022.
In Ethiopia, an estimated 5.7 million people affected by severe drought need food assistance.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo in the claim is not related to the Oromia region of Ethiopia.
The original image shows dead animal carcasses lying outside of the village of Dambas, Kenya. The photo was taken on 16 March 2006 and is credited to Chris Jackson/Getty Images.
