This Facebook post with a photo, supposedly of a Zimbabwean at a polling booth in the 23 August 2023 general elections, is FALSE.
The image is of a man wrapped in a towel being assisted at a polling booth.
The photo was also published by DW Africa on its verified Facebook page.
Zimbabweans went to the polls on 23 August 2023 to elect the President, parliamentary and local government leaders.
But is the photo from Zimbabwe?
A Google reverse image search established that the photo was taken in Kisumu, Kenya, during the 9 August 2022 general elections.
NTV Kenya published the photo on its verified X (formerly Twitter) account and indicated that the man turned up in a towel to vote, reportedly after leaving his home in a hurry.
The photo was also published by TUKO and Mpasho.co.ke. TUKO identified the man as Jamal Victor.
PesaCheck looked into a Facebook post with a photo, supposedly of a Zimbabwean voter at a polling booth during the 23 August 2023 general elections, and found it to be FALSE.
