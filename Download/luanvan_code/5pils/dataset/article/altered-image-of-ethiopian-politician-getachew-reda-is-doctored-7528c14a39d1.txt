A Facebook image claimed to be that of Ethiopian politician Getachew Reda is ALTERED.
The image is accompanied by an Amharic text that translates to; “Getachew Reda continues to lie by saying that he is dead, having constipation, and someone is assigned on top of me. If the trumpet is blown to announce that Gecho is dead, who will attend the funeral for the person who has been found dead 10 times and deceived the Idir 10 times?”
Idir is an Ethiopian traditional institution, similar to life insurance.
“I finished my journey. I have fought the evil battle. I divided my people with my twin tongues,” the text on the photo reads.
However, Google reverse image search results indicate that the image is digitally manipulated.
The original image was shared on the iStock website with the caption, “Lawyer lying in a coffin still holding his briefcase.” The image was uploaded on 17 June 2009 and is credited to izusek.
The original picture was also published on the Getty Images website.
Getachew Reda is an adviser to the president of the Tigray region. The regional forces have fought against the Ethiopian federal government troops since November 2020.
The African Union is scheduled to hold peace talks in South Africa on 24 October 2022, with the intention of resolving the conflict.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook image claimed to be that of Tigray politician Getachew Reda and found it to be ALTERED.
