A Facebook post with an image of weapons and claiming the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) has disarmed Ethiopian Federal Government soldiers in Adaha Berga district is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo text accompanying the image translates to; “Victory to OLA: The Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) defeated and disarmed the army of Prosperity government in Adaha Berga district, which is located around Addis Ababa. The Oromo Liberation Army is defeating the Prosperity Army from North to South and East to West.”
In November 2022, fighting between the Ethiopian army and Oromo forces intensified, as a peace deal between the federal government and Tigrayan leaders was being negotiated.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the photo is not related to the conflict between the OLA and the national government troops.
The Dawn website published the photo on 25 May 2022 in an article titled, “Punjab govt says weapons recovered from vehicles of PTI’s Lahore workers; party rubbishes claims.” The caption indicates that the weapons were recovered from Lahore members of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image and a claim that the Oromo Liberation Army has disarmed federal government soldiers in Adaha Berga, Ethiopia, and finds it to be FALSE.
