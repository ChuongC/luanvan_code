An image is being shared on social media in which Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar can be seen holding a placard and promoting an online trading application. The placard reads – “Deposit 20Rs – Daily income 2000Rs”. Some users trolled Akshay Kumar for this endorsement. Let’s fact-check if he in fact promoted this app.
Claim: Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar holding a placard that reads ,“ Deposit 20Rs – Daily Income 2000Rs” while promoting an online trading app.
Fact: The original photo of Akshay Kumar holding a placard was shared by himself through his Twitter handle on 09 April 2020. Here, the placard reads,”#DilSe ThankYou”. This image was morphed and then edited to portray like an advertisement promoting an online trading app. Also, there is no proof of Akshay Kumar endorsing this app. Hence, the claim made in this post is FALSE.
We ran a reverse image search and found a picture of Akshay Kumar holding a placard which reads, “#DILSE THANKYOU”.  Search results can be seen here.
Upon further investigation, we found that he initially shared this pic on his Twitter handle on 09 April 2020, in order to thank the COVID-19 frontline warriors for their work during first lockdown.
