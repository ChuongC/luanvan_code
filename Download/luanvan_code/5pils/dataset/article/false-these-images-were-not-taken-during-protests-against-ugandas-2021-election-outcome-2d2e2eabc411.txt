A Facebook post with images claiming to show a protest in Nateete, a Kampala suburb, following the announcement of Uganda’s general election results declaring President Yoweri Museveni as winner, is FALSE.
National Unity Platform’s (NUP) presidential candidate, Robert Kyagulanyi, has disputed the outcome of the January 14, election that gave victory to Uganda’s longest serving President Yoweri Museveni.
The tense polls were characterised by a total Internet shutdown and military deployment as incumbent Mr Museveni raced against 10 presidential contenders to extend his 35-year tenure.
The post claims the photos were taken in Nateete, Rubaga division in Kampala, amidst protests following the election results.
A Google reverse search of image 1, however, reveals the photo was taken in the 2009 Buganda protests in the capital, Kampala.
This, after supporters of Buganda Kingdom leader, Kabaka Ronald Mutebi, were angered by the government’s attempt to stop him from attending a youth event north of the capital, citing fears of violence.
Additionally, a Google reverse search of image 2 reveals it was taken in 2018, during protests demanding the release of Mr Kyagulanyi, who doubles as a Kyadondo East Constituency member of parliament.
He was arrested in the north-western district of Arua, for allegedly stoning the presidential convoy.
PesaCheck has looked into a claim that two images were taken during a protest against President Yoweri Museveni’s victory in the 2021 polls, and finds it to be FALSE.
