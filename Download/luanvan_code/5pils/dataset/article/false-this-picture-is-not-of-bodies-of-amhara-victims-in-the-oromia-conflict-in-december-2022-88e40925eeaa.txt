This Facebook post with an image purportedly of bodies of Amhara victims in the ongoing conflict in Wollega, Oromia region of Ethiopia, in December 2022 is FALSE.
The Amharic text accompanying the photo translates to; “The ‘Oromo allied army’ meaning the Oromo Special Forces, the OLF, the Oromo Liberation Army, the Oromia Militia, and the local youth have joined forces and massacred more than 300 Amharas in Wollega today alone. Although thousands of besieged Amharas are calling for help, they do not get any help yet.”
However, Google reverse image search results established that the image has been online since 2020. This website published the photo on 25 December 2020, along with other pictures.
As seen in the screenshot below, PesaCheck found the photo publication date using Google translate.
The same photo was also posted on Twitter on 12 January 2021.
Amhara Media Corporation reported through its verified Facebook page that civilians in East Wollega were attacked and were calling for help. Also, Addis Standard reported that Fano militants attacked civilians in East Wollega, leading to the displacement of civilians from 19 villages.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to be of the bodies of Amhara victims in the ongoing conflict in Wollega, in the Oromia region of Ethiopia, in December 2022 and found it to be FALSE.
