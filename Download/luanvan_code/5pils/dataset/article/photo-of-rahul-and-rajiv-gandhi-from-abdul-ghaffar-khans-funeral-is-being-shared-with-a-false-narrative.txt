Photo of Rahul and Rajiv Gandhi from Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s funeral is being shared with a false narrative - FACTLY

A post is being shared widely on social media with a claim that Rahul and Rajiv Gandhi have offered Islamic prayers at Indira Gandhi’s funeral. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post. 
Claim: Rahul and Rajiv Gandhi offering Islamic prayers in front of Indira Gandhi’s body.
Fact: The photo was taken at Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s funeral, not at Indira Gandhi’s funeral. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo was run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, a YouTube video with the same photo as thumbnail was found in the search results. 
 The title of the YouTube video is – ‘A Rare Clip of Rajiv Gandhi in the Funeral Prayer of Bacha Khan – KP Digest’ (Bacha Khan is another name of Abdul Ghaffar Khan). Visuals similar to the photo can be seen in the video. Even in a tweet by a Pakistani Politician, it can found that the photo is related to Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s funeral. 
Also, in a news article published by AP News in 1988, it can be read that Rajiv Gandhi ‘travelled to Peshawar to pay tribute to Ghaffar Khan’.
Indira Gandhi’s funeral photos and video can be seen here and here, which look very different from the posted photo.
To sum it up, the photo of Rahul and Rajiv Gandhi from Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s funeral is being shared as a photo taken at Indira’s funeral.
