This Facebook post claiming to show Ethiopian Air Force attacks on Tigray cities and weapon warehouses is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by a post in Amharic that translates as; “The last hour. The Ethiopian Air Force carried out a successful attack on selected Tigray cities and weapon warehouses this evening. Innocent Tigrayan you are the brothers and sisters of all Ethiopians. It is our brotherly advice that at least during the last hours you should refrain from the useless sacrifice you are making for the sake of the elderly’s evil objective of destroying the country. Save your life by surrendering to your brother’s army in peace. Do not touch Ethiopia.”
However, Google reverse image search results established that the image is unrelated to the war in Ethiopia.
The image was shared on the Alamy website with the caption; “A U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet fight aircraft with Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323, carrying ten AIM-120 and two AIM-9X Air-to-Air missiles, during a training mission over the W-291 training area March 6, 2019 in Southern California.”
The picture was also published on other websites.
The conflict in northern Ethiopia is yet to be resolved, despite efforts by different actors, including by the United Nations and the African Union (AU). However, Redwan Hussien, the Ethiopian Prime Minister’s National Security Adviser, announced that the AU-led peace talks are set to be held on 24 October 2022, in South Africa.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post claiming to show an attack on Tigray by the Ethiopian Air Force and found it to be FALSE.
