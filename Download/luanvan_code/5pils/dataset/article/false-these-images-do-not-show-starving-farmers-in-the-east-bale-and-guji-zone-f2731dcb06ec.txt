Images shared on Facebook claiming to show starving farmers in East Bale and Guji zone of Ethiopia are FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo text posted along with the photo translates, “The farmers in East Bale and Guji zone are starving, let us help them and stand with them, dear people.”
There are reports of drought in the southern part of Oromia, especially in Borana and Guji zones, resulting in dire situations. Thousands of livestock have perished. Half a million people, according to reports, need relief aid.
But the photos used to advance the claim are false. Reverse image search results here, here, here, and here show that the images in the claim are not related to the East Bale and Guji zone.
The first image was posted on The New Humanitarian news website on 28 July 2011. The photo features in an article describing “a cow is part of the family” the image is credited to Jaspreet Kindra/IRIN.
The second image was published on the Naharnet news website on 8 November 2013, in an article “Hunger Stalks 1.1 Million People in C. Africa”.
The third image was posted on the Aljazeera news website on 24 March 2021. The image description says the article is related to the Kenya government order that Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps be closed.
The last image was tweeted by a Member of the Federal Parliament of Somalia, Abdullahi Godah Barre, on 20 November 2021. The image describes “the Somali people endure the drought …”
PesaCheck has looked into Facebook images claiming to show farmers starving in the East Bale and Guji zone and finds them to be FALSE.
