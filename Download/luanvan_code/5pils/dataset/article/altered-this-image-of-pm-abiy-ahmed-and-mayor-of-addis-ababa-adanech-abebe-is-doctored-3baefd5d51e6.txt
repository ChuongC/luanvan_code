An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Mayor of Addis Ababa Adanech Abebe on a film poster is ALTERED.
The Amharic text accompanying the image reads “Grey”, and the headline on the photo says “Fifty Shades of Grey”.
On 28 September 2021, the Addis Ababa City Council appointed Adanech Abebe to serve as the mayor of Ethiopia’s capital for the next five years. She was sworn in as the first female mayor during the first general assembly of the Administration.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo used to support and advance the claim has been doctored.
The original image is a poster featuring actors Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan promoting Fifty Shades of Grey, a 2015 British-American romantic drama film.
The actors’ names on the poster were also altered to create the claim image.
