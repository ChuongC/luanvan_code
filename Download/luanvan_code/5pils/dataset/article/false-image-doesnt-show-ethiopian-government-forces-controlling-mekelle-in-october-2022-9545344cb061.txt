A Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) controlling Mekelle in October 2022 is FALSE.
The Amharic text accompanying the 26 October 2022 photo translates to; “Breaking: Ethiopian defence forces and the Allied army have controlled Mekelle city and are entering the city centre.”
Mekelle is the capital city of the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia.
Google reverse image search results on the photo do not show ENDF controlling the city of Mekelle in October 2022, as claimed.
The image was published on the Nova news website on 1 September 2022 in the article: “The denunciation of the Tigers: A massive Ethiopian offensive has begun”.
The picture was also published on this website in the article headlined, “Ethiopia: new offensive by Eritrean forces, heavy fighting underway at the border — Agenzia Nova”, on 20 September 2022.
Additionally, there is no official report that ENDF took control of Mekelle in October 2022.
On 18 October 2022, news reports indicated that ENDF had captured three towns in the Tigray region — Shire, Alamata, and Korem.
The Ethiopian government and regional forces from Tigray agreed to cease hostilities in an agreement brokered by the African Union on 2 November 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) controlling Mekelle, the capital city of Tigray region in October 2022, and finds it to be FALSE.
