This Facebook post with an image claiming to show a 2022 Russia’s attack on Ukraine following ongoing war between the two countries is FALSE.
“Ukrainian officials said that Ukraine had foiled Russia’s missile and heavy weapons attack in all directions, according to Politico. It has been said that especially Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, is the main victim of Russia’s heavy artillery fire,” part of the Amharic text reads. Politico has made different reports on Russia’s attack on Ukraine, as seen here, here, and here.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image does not show the claimed attack. The photo has been online since 2015.
The Daily Mail website published it in 2015. The description of the image said, “A Russian TOS-1A multiple rocket launcher fires during the field show programmes during the International Military-Technical Forum” The same photo was published on the 19FortyFive website, and Image credit is given to Creative Commons.
These websites seen here, here, and here published the same photo years before the Ukraine-Russian war started.
