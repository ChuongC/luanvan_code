This Facebook post with images claiming to show a drone attack in Shire, the Tigray region of Ethiopia, in March 2022 is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates to “Breaking News. Today around 5:20 AM, a drone strike took place in Shire town during secret peace talks. The government has not yet commented on the attack.”
The image was posted on 4 March 2022. Two digitally combined pictures are attached to the post.
However, as seen here and here, Google and TinEye reverse image search results reveal that the photos do not show the said attack.
The first image shows an airstrike in Mekelle, the capital of the Tigray region. The picture was shared on the Avvenire.it website on 21 October 2021.
The description of the image from Google translate reads, “The black smoke of explosives on the outskirts of Macalle.” Macalle in the Italian language refers to Mekelle.
As seen here and here, the same image has been used online to show the airstrike in Mekelle in October 2021.
The second image has been online since 2019, as seen here, here, and here. The Exame website gives image credit to Getty Images/Anadolu Agency.
