A claim on Twitter that Ugandans were shot dead in Juba for burning charcoal on February 10, 2023, is false and misleading.
Writer: Emmanuel Bida Thomas
A claim by a Twitter user in a tweet on February 10, 2023, that “Ugandans were shot dead in Juba for burning charcoal” is false.
“On 30th January 2023, Ugandans were shot dead in Juba for burning charcoal. The incident comes in a period when thousands of Ugandans have been being killed without both governments taking concern,” the tweet reads in part.
A similar tweet was made by another user here.
Though the tweet received little attention on social media, it makes a highly misleading claim, particularly to audiences who do not follow credible media reports from South Sudan.

So, what makes this claim incorrect? Here’s a quick overview:
A Google reverse image search yields the same image that was used on Facebook and Twitter on February 2, 2023. It depicts the bodies of over 20 Kajo-keji residents killed in a cattle-related incident in South Sudan’s Central Equatoria State. They were buried in a mass grave in Kajo-Keji.
According to Radio Tamazuj and Eye Radio, the victims were unarmed civilians at Likamerok Boma in Lire Payam, Kajo-keji county. These reports make no mention of Ugandans.
A keyword search for “Ugandans killed in South Sudan 2023” on Google yields no results for any news report about the incident depicted in the tweet’s photo. This year, no Ugandans have been killed in South Sudan.
Conclusion:
The claim that Ugandans were among those killed in a photo shared on Facebook and Twitter on February 2, 2023, is false. The image shows over 20 Kajo-keji residents who were killed in a cattle-related incident in South Sudan’s Central Equatoria State, and no credible news reports mention any Ugandans being among the victims.
