This image shared on Facebook claiming to show the front page of the Reporter newspaper is ALTERED.
The headline of one of the news stories on the purported front page translates as; “TPLF is facing massive protests in Mekelle Sebea Enderta.”
A photo of security forces and civilians appears below the headline.
However, a manual search of the newspaper front page on the Ethiopian Reporter Facebook page showed that the cover under investigation is digitally manipulated. Although the page is not verified, it is linked to the publication’s website, indicating its authenticity.
The headline of the original news story reads; “People were killed in a conflict that broke out in two neighbouring zones of the Amhara region.” No image is attached to support the story.
The other stories and accompanying images on the front page remain the same.
A similar claim with the same image was shared on the Balderas for True Democracy’s (Balderas) verified Facebook page. “More than 57 civilians were killed in a dispute between residents of Mekelle city and armed groups of the TPLF,” part of Balderas’ post states. Balderas is one of the political parties in Ethiopia.
The claim about TPLF facing protests in Mekelle has not been reported by any media outlet.
Additionally, PesaCheck did not get reliable information on the contents of the headline and the claim made by Balderas as there is a communication blackout in the Tigray region due to the war in the northern parts of Ethiopia.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook image claiming to show the cover page of the Reporter newspaper and finds it to be ALTERED.
