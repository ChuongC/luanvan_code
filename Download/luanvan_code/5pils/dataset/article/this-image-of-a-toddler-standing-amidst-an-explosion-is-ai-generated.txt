In the context of the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, an image depicting a toddler standing in a house destroyed by an explosion has been extensively shared on social media. This image is claimed to be a real-life depiction of a Palestinian child. While some users have posted it as a representative image, others in the comment section are questioning its authenticity. Therefore, let’s attempt to verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of a Palestinian child amidst an explosion.
Fact: This is an AI-Generated image and does not depict any real-life incident.
Upon conducting a reverse image search of the viral photo, we discovered that it was uploaded by gdh News (archived), a media outlet based in Turkey, on 11 October 2023. However, the image description clarifies that the image represents life in Gaza as visualized by Artificial Intelligence (AI), indicating that it’s not a real-life photograph.
Furthermore, by using the generative AI software, Stable Diffusion, and giving appropriate prompts, we managed to generate similar images.
Hence, it becomes clear that the widely circulated image of a toddler standing in front of an explosion is generated by Artificial Intelligence and not an actual photograph.
