In the context of Rahul Gandhi’s ongoing Bharat Jodo Yatra, a couple of images of a huge crowd gathering are being shared on social media claiming that it shows people welcoming Rahul Gandhi in Chanvali of Rajasthan’s Jhalawar district. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Images of a huge crowd at Chanvali, Rajasthan supporting Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra.
Fact: Images show a crowd gathering at the program of Pujya Dada Guru Maharaj’s holy Bhandara held on 03 December 2022 at Jay Gurudev Ashram, Mathura, UP. Moreover, Rahul Gandhi reached Chanvali, Rajasthan only on the evening of 04 December 2022. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
We ran a reverse image search of these two viral images and found that the same images were already posted on the Facebook page of Pankaj Maharaj on 03 December 2022. As per the description, the images show the huge crowd gathered in the program of Pujya Dada Guru Maharaj’s holy Bhandara held on 03 December 2022 at Jaygurudev Ashram, Mathura, UP. Also, the visuals from the live stream of this event matched with that of viral images. They can be seen here and here.
Also, as per the official schedule of the Yatra and the media reports, Rahul Gandhi reached Chanvali only on the evening of 04 December 2022 and attended a public event.
Evidently, the visuals of the crowd at Rahul Gandhi’s meeting do not match with that of viral images.
To sum it up, the viral images do not show a crowd gathering at Rahul’s Bharat Jodo Yatra in Rajasthan.
