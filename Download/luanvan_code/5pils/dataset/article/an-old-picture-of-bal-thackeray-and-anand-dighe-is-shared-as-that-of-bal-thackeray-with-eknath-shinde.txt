A photo through a post is being widely shared on social media claiming that the photo is an old picture of Bal Thackeray with Eknath Shinde. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Old picture of Bal Thackeray with Eknath Shinde.
Fact: This is an old picture of Bal Thackeray applying tilak to Anand Dighe. Anand Dighe was a leader of Shiv Sena who reportedly mentored Eknath Shinde. He was a prominent leader in Thane, Maharashtra; he died at the age of 50 after suffering from a heart attack. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When reverse image search is done on the photo, the same photo was found on Twitter. The official Twitter account of ‘Shiv Sena’ tweeted the same picture on 26 August 2021. The picture was tweeted saying that it was posted in the memory of ‘Anand Dighe’, a prominent member of Shiv Sena. The tweet does not mention anything about Eknath Shinde.
