A Facebook post with an image alleged to be of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) soldiers capturing “a key military position” and marching toward Alamata in October 2022 is FALSE.
The Amharic text accompanying the photo, which was shared on 13 October 2022, translates as; “Breaking News: The Ethiopian coalition forces, led by the Ethiopian Defence Forces, captured a key military position that would allow them to control Alamata. The combined force is 15 km from Alamata. It is marching towards Alamata by controlling important places located in the distance.”
Google reverse image search results established that the photo has been online since July 2021.
BBC Afaan Oromoo published the image on 24 July 2021 in an article headlined; “Tigray Army: Did Tigray forces really achieve a ‘great victory’ in Afar?” The image is credited to the Amhara Media Corporation.
The image was also published on this website on 29 July 2021 in another article with the headline, “Jeff Pearce unveiled new information about TPLF.”
News reports state that the ENDF took control of the towns of Shire, Alamata, and Korem on 18 October 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claimed to be of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces soldiers marching toward Alamata in October 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
