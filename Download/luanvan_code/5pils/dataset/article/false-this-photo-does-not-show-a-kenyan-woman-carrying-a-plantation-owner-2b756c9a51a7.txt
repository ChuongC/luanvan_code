A Twitter post claiming to show a woman from central Kenya carrying a white “plantation owner” on her back is FALSE.
The caption accompanying the image reads, “The colonial burden: A woman in central Kenya carries a plantation owner. These stories must be unearthed and told clearly and loudly”.
However, a reverse image search finds that the photo of a Sikkimese woman carrying a British man on her back is from West Bengal, India.
The photo was taken around the year 1900.
West Bengal is a state in eastern India, and was a part of the region of the Indian subcontinent ruled by the British East India Company from 1757 to 1858. As the influence of the British crown gew it became part of the British Empire in India and became part of the Bengal region.
However, once the British left in 1947, Bengal was subdivided again. The eastern side of Bengal, which was mostly Muslim, became Eastern Pakistan and was later named Bangladesh, while the western side became India’s West Bengal State that lies between the Himalayas and the Bay of Bengal with its capital located at Kolkata (formely Calcutta).
PesaCheck has looked into a Twitter post claiming to show a woman from central Kenya carrying a plantation owner on her back and finds it to be FALSE.
