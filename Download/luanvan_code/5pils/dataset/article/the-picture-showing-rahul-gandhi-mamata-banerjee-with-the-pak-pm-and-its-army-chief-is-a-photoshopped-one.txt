A post with the picture showing Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee, Navjot Sidhu and Shatrughan Sinha with the Pak PM and its Army Chief is being shared by many Facebook users. In the post, it was written that voting for Congress was like voting for Pakistan. Let’s try to analyze the authenticity of the picture posted.
The archived version of the post can be found here.
Claim: Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his party leaders Shatrughan Sinha, Navjot Singh Sidhu and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee are in the same pic with Pakistan’s PM Imran Khan and its Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa
Fact:  The original photo of the picture posted can be seen in the article of the news agency ‘ARY NEWS’. The photo is from the meeting of Pakistan Army Chief with its PM Imran Khan to discuss their country’s security-related matters. No Indian political leader can be seen in the original pic. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On doing the Google reverse image search, the photo was found in the ‘ARY NEWS’ article dated Apr 4, 2019 with the title “Army Chief calls on PM Khan, discusses security-related matters”. The image in this article is photoshopped to show as if Rahul Gandhi, Shatrughan Sinha, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Mamata Banerjee are with Pakistan’s PM and its Army Chief.
Hence, the picture showing Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee, Navjot Sidhu and Shatrughan Sinha with the Pak PM and its Army Chief is a photoshopped one.
