This Facebook post with an image claiming to be of Chinese military exercise in Taiwan in January 2023 is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by an Amharic text post partly translated to; “28 Chinese aircraft conducted military exercises in Taiwan. China announced yesterday that it has conducted a military exercise in Taiwan. According to the country’s Eastern command, 28 aircraft took part in the military exercise near Taiwan.”
“The command also pointed out in its statement that an exercise that will enable repel and suppress potential attacks over the sea and air was conducted. Beijing’s military exercise for the second time in a month has exacerbated the confrontation between Beijing and Taipei,” the post added.
Reuters reported on 8 January 2023 that 28 Chinese aircraft had entered Taiwan’s air defence zone.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the image is old and unrelated to the 8 January 2023 incident.
The picture was shared on the Atlantic Council website on 1 October 2010 in the article headlined, “U.S. questions Turkey’s military exercise with China.”
The same photo was also published on this website on 16 October 2010.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to be of China’s military exercise in Taiwan in January 2023 and found it to be FALSE.
