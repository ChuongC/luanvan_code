This Facebook post claiming to show the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) controlling Aksum, in the Tigray region is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo text accompanying the 19 October 2022 photo translates to; “Breaking News: We congratulate the heroic Ethiopian Defense Forces fully controlled Aksum.”
However, a Google reverse image search established that the picture was published online before the conflict in Ethiopia resumed in August 2022.
The image was published on the Tghat website on 19 February 2022 and it is of Ethiopian soldier Geremew Demse. The photo was published in an article titled, “Geremew Demse: An Ethiopian Soldier from UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) to Mahbere Dego Massacre.”
The Ethiopian government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) resumed hostilities on 24 August 2022. Both parties have been fighting since 2020 and blame each other for the breakdown of a truce declared in March 2022.
Besides, there have been no news reports of the ENDF controlling Aksum as claimed. Instead, the Ethiopian government forces have taken control of Alamata, Korem, and Shire towns in the Tigray region.
PesaCheck has looked into an image on a Facebook post claiming to be of the Ethiopian National Defense Force controlling Aksum and finds it to be FALSE.
