A post shared on Facebook with images purportedly of missiles that Iran gave to Russia in October 2022 is FALSE.
The post with a headline in Amharic that translates to, “The support given to Russia that has shocked the West”, was shared on 18 October 2022.
“Iran, which is a strong ally of Russia, has provided additional weapons support to Russia,” the post reads in part, adding: “It is known that Iran has provided a large number of modern drones to the Russian army that is fighting in Ukraine earlier.
Now it is known that it has supplied missiles known as Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar missiles. The missiles have a range of 300km and 700km”.
The post is accompanied by two images of the missiles. Another image is of the maps of Russia and Iran. The presidents of both countries — Russia’s Vladimir Putin on the right and Iran’s Ebrahim Raisi on the left — are in one of the attached photos.
On 19 October 2022 Reuters reported that Iran “agreed to transport more missiles and armed drones to Russia”. The report indicates that the weapons have improved accuracy and are from the Fateh and Zolfaghar missiles family.
However, the pictures that we are looking into are not of the missiles Iran provided to Russia in October 2022.
Yandex image search results show that the first picture depicts a different type of Iranian missile defence system, which was launched in 2019.
The image was first used by The Defense post in August 2019 and credited to Fars News Agency. It is captioned: “Iranian President Hassan Rouhani unveiled the Bavar-373 air defense system at an official ceremony in Tehran on August 22, 2019”.
The second image bearing the maps and the presidents was shared by the Gulf International Forum in July 2021, according to Google reverse image search results.
The third image is of a homegrown ballistic missile called Zolfaqar, which was launched by Iran’s Defense Ministry in September 2016, Yandex reverse search results established. The image was shared here and here with a similar caption.
PesaCheck has looked into a post shared on Facebook claiming to show Iranian missiles provided to Russia in October 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
