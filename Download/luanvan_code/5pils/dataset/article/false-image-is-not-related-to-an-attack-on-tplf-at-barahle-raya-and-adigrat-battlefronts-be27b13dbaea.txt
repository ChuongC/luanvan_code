A Facebook image claiming to show an Ethiopian Air Force attack on the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) at Barahle, Raya, and Adigrat battlefronts is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by a post in Amharic that translates to; “Breaking. Our heroic air force! Our heroic Air Force, which is making the terrorist group (sic) urinate on itself, has inflicted heavy losses on the barbaric TPLF on three fronts today. A successful attack on the Barahle, Raya, and Adigrat fronts. I don’t listen to anyone, said our heroic air force. Victory for Ethiopia.”
However, Google reverse image search results showed that the image is old and unrelated to the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia.
The photo was shared on this website on 20 April 2015, with the caption, “Neat and quite tight formation of a pair Libyan Arab Republic AF MiG-23’s”.
The image was also published on this website on 20 May 2016.
The war in northern Ethiopia began in November 2020, and reports, as seen here and here, indicate that the federal government has taken control of Tigray cities previously administered by Tigray forces.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook image claiming to show an Ethiopian Air Force attack on the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) at Barahle, Raya, and Adigrat battlefronts and found it to be FALSE.
