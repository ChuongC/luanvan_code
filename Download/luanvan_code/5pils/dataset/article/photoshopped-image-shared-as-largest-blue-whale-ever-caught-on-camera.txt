An image is being widely shared on Facebook with a claim that it is the largest Blue Whale ever caught on camera. Let’s analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of the largest Blue Whale ever caught on camera.
Fact: The image is not a real one. It is digitally created by bringing two different photos together to make it appear like a gigantic blue whale swimming under a suspension bridge. So, the claim is FALSE.
When the image is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, many search results  were obtained. While going through those search results, ‘Reddit’ had the same image but with the watermark of an Instagram account ‘umutrecberart’. When searched for that account, it was found to be that of a ‘digital artist’. The account had the image in the post and it was written that the image is digitally created by bringing two different photos together using the ‘Photoshop’ tool.
In another Instagram post, the artist has also put the two photos which were used in the creation of that image. 
To sum it up, a digitally created image is being shared as an image of the largest Blue Whale ever caught on camera.
