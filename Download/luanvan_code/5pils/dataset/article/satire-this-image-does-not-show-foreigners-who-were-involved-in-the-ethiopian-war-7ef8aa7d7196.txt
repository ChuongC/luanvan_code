This Twitter image claiming to show foreigners who were involved in the ongoing war in the northern parts of Ethiopia is FALSE.
“Glory to those who are sacrificed at the battle of Wello,” the post in the Amharic language reads.
To support this claim, an image that shows five people in military uniform holding weapons is attached to the post. However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image shows the cast of a movie dubbed Tropic Thunder. It was shared on the No Film School website on 24 March 2021 to support an article titled “8 Great Filmmaking Lessons from “Tropic Thunder”.
The movie, Tropic Thunder, was released in 2008. The five actors in military uniform can be seen at around minute 1:15 of the trailer.
The claim was made after Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, claimed that foreigners had joined the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces and fought against the Ethiopian government at the battle of Wello front. And the claim is made under the context of ridiculing the Prime minister’s claim.
The war in the Tigray region started a year ago in November 2020. It has since intensified and now affects other areas like the Afar and Amhara regions.
PesaCheck has looked into a Twitter image claiming to show foreigners who were involved in the war that was held in the northern parts of Ethiopia and finds it to be FALSE.
