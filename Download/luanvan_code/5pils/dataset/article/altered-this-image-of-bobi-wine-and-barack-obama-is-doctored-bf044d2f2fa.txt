A tweet with an image purporting to show Ugandan politician Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine, and President Barack Obama having a conversation is DOCTORED.
In the image shared on Twitter on April 27, 2021, Bobi Wine is seen walking beside the former United States president.
Bobi Wine, a former presidential candidate, is wearing a mask while President Obama is unmasked.
However, a Google reverse image search of the photo shows Obama was talking to Narendra Modi, Indiaâ€™s prime minister, and not Bobi Wine as claimed in the Twitter post.
The original image of the two leaders dates back to 2015, and has been featured here and here.
The doctored image replaces the Indian prime minister with Bobi Wine in his stead.
Also, a meeting between President Obama and Bobi Wine would attract wide media attention both internationally and locally. However, no credible media has reported such news.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image showing Bobi Wine and former US President Barack Obama having a conversation and finds that it was ALTERED.
