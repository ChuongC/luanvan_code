Publication Date:2023-02-23T07:26:12+00:00
A social media post shared a photo of two people stuck under concrete ruins. The post description claims they were found during the terrible earthquake in Turkey. Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.
Claim: A photo of a couple stuck under rubble caused by the Turkey earthquake.
Fact: This viral photo is a still from the HBO TV series Game of Thrones. This photo is available on the official photo book of Game of Thrones. Hence the claim made in the post is False.
We ran a reverse image search on Ynadex to learn more about the viral photo. This led us to many websites which contained this photo. On the website of the book publishing agency Simon and Schuster, a book titled ‘The Photography of Game of Thrones, the official photo book of Season 1 to Season 8’ is available for purchase. One of the photos in the collection is the same as the viral picture.
This book is also available on the website of barnesandnoble and belfastexposed. It contains a collection of photos captured on the set of Game of Thrones. The photo shows two characters from the famous TV show, Cersei Lannister and Jaime Lannister.
A scene from the show in which both characters die was uploaded to YouTube by an unverified channel. At 1:48, in this video, one can see both characters lying amidst rubble the same way as in the photo.
To sum up, a still from the TV series Game of Thrones is shared as a photo of a couple stuck under the rubble in the aftermath of the Turkey earthquake.
