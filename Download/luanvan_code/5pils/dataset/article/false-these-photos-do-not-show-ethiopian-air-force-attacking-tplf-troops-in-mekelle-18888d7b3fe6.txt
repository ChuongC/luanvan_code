A Facebook post with images claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attacking the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) fighters in Mekelle is FALSE.
Three images accompany the Afaan Oromo text that translates as; “The Ethiopian Air Force has turned its full attention to Mekele and is destroying Junta, the enemy of Ethiopia. At present, Mekele is in terror. Mekelle is completely in the drone camera’s view.”
Mekelle is the capital of Tigray region in Ethiopia.
On 26 August 2022, news reports indicated that an Ethiopian government airstrike hit Mekelle, killing several people. The airstrike came two days after fighting resumed between Federal government forces and the militants, ending a five-month ceasefire.
However, the images used to advance the claim are not recent. Yandex reverse image search results here, here, and here show that the pictures are not related to the conflict in Ethiopia.
The first image was published on the Euroradio website on 17 July 2014 to support an article titled, “Local confirms Russian cross-border rocket attack on Ukraine troops.”
The second image was published on the Mereja Forum website on 28 August 2021 with a caption stating that it showed the Ethiopian Air Force in action against TPLF in Debre Zebit, Amhara region.
The third image was published on the Wikimedia Commons website on 10 August 2012 with the description, “Four SU-34 in flight”. The image is credited to Aleksandr Markin.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with images claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attacking the TPLF troops in Mekelle and finds it to be FALSE.
