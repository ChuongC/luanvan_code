This Facebook post with an image claiming to show a Ukrainian girl confronting a Russian soldier is FALSE.
The text accompanying the image reads, “Ukraine child Vs Russian soldier. Brave!”
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the girl in the picture is not a Ukrainian facing up to a Russian soldier.
The photo was shared on The Times of Israel website on 1 January 2018 and shows a Palestinian girl confronting an Israeli soldier. The description of the image reads, “A’hd Tamimi, sister of the boy whose attempted arrest by an Israeli soldier led to a West Bank scuffle on August 28, faces up to a soldier in 2012.”
The same image was published on the algemeiner website on 31 December 2012. In addition, this video that was uploaded on YouTube on 24 December 2012 shows the Palestinian girl, Ahed Tamimi, whose image is attached to the claim, confronting an Israeli soldier.
Russian and Ukrainian delegations are holding discussions to resolve the ongoing conflict between the two countries.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a Ukrainian girl confronting a Russian soldier and found it to be FALSE.
