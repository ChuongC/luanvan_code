A Facebook post claiming that there was a plane crash at Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport is FALSE.
The post attaches images purportedly of survivors being rescued.
The same claim has been published on Twitter, adding that a Uganda Airlines plane crashed at the airport. “Thanks a lot Allah our brothers and sisters survived a plane crash at Entebbe International Airport,” the tweet reads.
However, the claim is misleading and false. A reverse image search of one of the photos using Google led us to the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority’s Twitter account, where a series of other pictures were posted.
The CAA was conducting an emergency exercise to test the airport’s readiness in case of an emergency involving passenger aircraft “veering off the runway and catching fire”.
CAA shared photos of the emergency exercise on its Twitter account, as seen here, here and here.
Additionally, Uganda Airlines urged the public not to be misled by crash claims. The Uganda Red Cross Society also tweeted confirming that the alleged accident was an Emergency Simulation exercise.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming that there was a plane crash at Entebbe International Airport and finds it to be FALSE.
