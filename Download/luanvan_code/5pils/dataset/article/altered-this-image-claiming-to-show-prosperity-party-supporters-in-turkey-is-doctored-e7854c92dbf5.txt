This Facebook post with an image claiming to show Prosperity Party supporters in Turkey is ALTERED.
The post in the Amharic language translates as; “When I first saw it, I laughed and ignored it thinking the image is doctored. Then, when I saw it repeatedly, I checked the Turkish website. They said, ‘Turkish Prosperity party supporters in Turkey’s biggest city, Antalya, marched for the leader of the East African country, Dr Abiy Ahmed.’ History has been made. The whole world understood you, except us. Happy birthday, king!!!”
Attached to the post is an image of people holding a banner with the picture of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. The banner has a message that reads: “Happy birthday Abichu”. Abichu is the Prime Minister’s nickname.
The post mentions Prosperity Party, the country’s ruling party formed in 2019 after the dissolving of Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) that had been in power since 1991.
Nevertheless, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo was digitally manipulated.
The original image was shared on this and this websites on 1 June 2020 and on 3 June 2021 respectively. It shows demonstrators in Turkey during the Gezi Park protest in June 2013.
As seen here and here, the original image was also published on other websites.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show Prosperity Party supporters in Turkey and finds it to be ALTERED.
