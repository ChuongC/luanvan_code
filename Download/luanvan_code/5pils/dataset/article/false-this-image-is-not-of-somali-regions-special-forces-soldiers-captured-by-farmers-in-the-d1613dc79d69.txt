This tweet, with an image of the Somali region’s Special Forces soldiers supposedly captured by Jarso farmers in the Oromia region in March 2023, is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by the text, “Daarood tribe Liyu (special) police that was sent by Pre Mustafe (Somali region president) was captured by Jarso Farmer’s militia. These criminals attacked farmers and burned two villages, crops they grew this season were also burned by Daarood special police.”
Jarso is a woreda (district) in Ethiopia’s Oromia region.
Google reverse image search results, however, established that the picture is not of the Somali region’s special troops captured by farmers in the Oromia region in March 2023.
The photo was shared on the Camelot Amhara Media Facebook page on 7 November 2020 and it is of uniformed Tigray special forces soldiers on the ground with two armed men in Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) and Amhara special forces uniforms standing next to them.
The image was also published on this Facebook page on 7 November 2020. In addition, the photo attached to the post is not of soldiers in Ethiopian Somali special forces uniforms.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image supposedly of members of the Somali region’s special forces captured by Jarso farmers in the Oromia region in March 2023 and found it to be FALSE.
