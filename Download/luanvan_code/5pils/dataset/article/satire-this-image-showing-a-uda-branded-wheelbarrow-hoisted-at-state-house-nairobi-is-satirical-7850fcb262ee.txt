This Facebook post with an image showing a United Democratic Alliance (UDA)-branded wheelbarrow hoisted at State House in Nairobi, Kenya, is SATIRICAL.
The post reads: “Finally wheelbarrow inside the statehouse.”
The wheelbarrow image appears to have been superimposed on the original photo of the State House as there are clear lines surrounding it, pixelated, the handles are cropped, and the clouds are darker than the surrounding — signs that it was edited.
A Google reverse search shows that State House updated its cover photo on Facebook and Twitter with images of the official residence of the Kenyan president.
The wheelbarrow does not appear on the official State House pages. Instead, there are three flags; the Kenyan flag, the East African Community flag, and the Presidential Standard, unveiled during President William Ruto’s inauguration on 13 September 2022.
The presidential standard is a flag used as a symbol of the head of state. President Ruto uses a yellow flag with a wheelbarrow sign, his United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party’s symbol.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image showing a United Democratic Alliance (UDA)-branded wheelbarrow hoisted at State House in Nairobi, Kenya, and finds it to be SATIRICAL.
