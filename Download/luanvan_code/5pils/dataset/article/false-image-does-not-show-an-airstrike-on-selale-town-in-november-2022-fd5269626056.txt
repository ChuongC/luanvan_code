A Facebook post with an image claiming to show an air raid on civilians in Selale town, Oromia, by the Ethiopian government is FALSE.
Published in Afaan Oromo, the post translates to; “Inbox. Prosperity (Ethiopia’s ruling Prosperity Party) government carried out an air attack on civilians in Selale city.”
Selale is in Oromia region, north of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital.
There are media reports that the Ethiopian military launched airstrikes on some towns in the Oromia region in November 2022. The reports put the civilian deaths at more than 30, with many injured in four drone strikes in Mendi town.
Google reverse image search results, however, show that the photo in the claim is not of government air raids on Selale town in 2022.
The Al-Monitor website published the image on 16 March 2021 with the caption, “The Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone, at Gecitkale military airbase near Famagusta in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on 16 December 2019.” The photo is credited to Birol Berek/AFP via Getty Images.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a picture purportedly of Ethiopian Air Force strike against civilians in Selale town, Oromia, and finds it to be FALSE.
