A photo is being shared on social media claiming it is the picture of a chat and golgappa shop in India that was named after the new OpenAI’s chatbot ‘ChatGPT’. The photo shows a golgappa shop with the name ‘Chat GPT Corner’. In the wake of the internet buzz over OpenAI’s new artificial intelligence chatbot, ‘ChatGPT‘, many users sharing this photo stating that even street vendors in India are adopting the latest technological words for their business. Paytm Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma had also made a tweet about this photo stating, “One chat GPT combo please — Chat of Golgappa & Potato Tikki.” Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of a chat and golgappa shop in India named ‘Chat GPT Corner’.
Fact: The photo shared in the post is a morphed one. In the original photo, the chat and golgappa shop was named ‘Sai Chaat Corner’, not ‘Chat GPT Corner’. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search of the photo and by searching using relevant keywords on the internet, a similar photo was found published on the ‘Zomato’ website. The original photo published on the Zomato website shows the chat and golgappa shop name as ‘Sai Chaat Corner’.
‘Sai Chaat Corner’ street food shop is located in the South Extension 2 area of New Delhi. On comparing the photo shared in the post with that of the ‘Sai Chaat Corner’s photo published on the Zomato website, it can be confirmed that the photo shared in the post is a morphed one.
Another photo is also being shared on social media in a similar context claiming that it is a picture of the ‘Chaat GPT Corner’ street food shop in India. But, the photo shared in this post is also a morphed one. The original photo shows the billboard of Nungambakkam Chaat Corner in Chennai.
To sum it up, edited images are shared as pictures of golgappa shops in India that were named after the new OpenAI’s chatbot ‘ChatGPT’.
