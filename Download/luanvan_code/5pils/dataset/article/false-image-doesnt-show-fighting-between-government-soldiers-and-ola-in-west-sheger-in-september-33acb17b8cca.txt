An image shared on Facebook claiming to show a fighting between Ethiopian government soldiers and Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) in September 2022 is FALSE.
“Breaking_news: Oromo Liberation Front encircled and captured over 300 enemy soldiers in a fighting conducted in West Sheger, Boji Chokorsa district around Figa Kobera town,” the post in Afaan Oromoo reads in part.
The post adds: “The camp of soldiers of prosperity and many weapons have been seized during the fighting. The captives are being held at Orthodox church called Enango Kobara”.
The post is accompanied by an image of a soldier with a weapon seemingly preparing to fire.
Fighting has resumed between Ethiopian government forces and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) in multiple areas of the Oromia regional state.
Sheger or Finfinne is another name for Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, while Boji Chokorsa is the collective name of districts in West Wollega of the Oromia regional state. It is not in West Sheger as the post claims.
The image we are investigating doesn’t show fighting between government soldiers and OLA in September 2o22.
Google reverse image search results show the image has been online since 2021.
The image was featured in a story by Alwafd, an Arabic online news source, in August 2021.
PesaCheck has investigated an image shared on Facebook claiming to show fighting between Ethiopian government soldiers and Oromo Liberation Army troops and finds it to be FALSE.
