A Facebook post with an image claiming to show an Ethiopian Government messenger arrested in West Wollega with a hidden camera is FALSE.
The post, in Afaan Oromo shared on 31 July 2022, translates as; “In Karma Babene, in Kondala district of West Wollega, the messenger of prosperity (ruling party) was arrested while moving in the forest with a hidden camera.”
Media reports show that in June 2022, more than 200 civilians were killed in the war-torn West Wollega zone of Oromia regional state, following clashes between government security forces and Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), referred to by the government as “OLF/Shene”.
However, Google reverse image search results disclose that the image is unrelated to Ethiopia.
The Mongabay website published the picture on 26 September 2015, alongside an article with the title; “Indigenous group, Greenpeace partner to track illegal logging in the Amazon.”
According to the picture’s caption, it shows the Ka’apor people setting up trap cameras to monitor the indigenous territory in areas used by illegal loggers. The image is credited to Lunae Parracho / Greenpeace.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a messenger of the Ethiopian government arrested in a forest in West Wollega with a hidden camera and finds it to be FALSE.
