This tweet with an image purportedly of an Amhara arrested in Ethiopia’s Wollega region in 2022 is FALSE.
The picture is accompanied by an Amharic text that translates to; “In Anger Gutn, the Oromo special forces and militia are arresting Amaras who were defending themselves from attacks. The number of arrested Amharas reached four. Look, all these forces are for one Amhara. Cowards.”
Anger Gutn is in the Wollega zone of the Oromia region.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the particular image is old and unrelated to the conflict in Wollega. The photo is from Jimma, another zone in Oromia and it was shared on the BBC Afaan Oromoo website in 2020. The same photo was published on the Addis Standard website on 24 April 2020.
The photo is of a person identified as Abdo Abajobir, a resident of Jimma Zone, surrounded by government security forces.
PesaCheck has examined the tweet post purporting to show a person of Amhara ethnic background arrested in Ethiopia’s Wollega region in 2022 and found it to be FALSE.
