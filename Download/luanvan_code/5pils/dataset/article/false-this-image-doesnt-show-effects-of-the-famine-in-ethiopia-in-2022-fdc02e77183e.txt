A Facebook post claiming to show the Ethiopian people suffering due to the ‘artificial’ famine declared by the government is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo text, accompanied by an image of a malnourished child, translates, “The Ethiopian people are in such dire straits due to the artificial famine that the government has declared.”
Since November 2020, violent clashes in the northern region have led to tens of thousands of casualties and created a humanitarian emergency for millions of vulnerable people throughout the country.
In November 2021, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) stated that as many as 9.4 million people in Ethiopia require urgent food assistance due to the conflict in the East African country.
There are news reports claiming the Ethiopian government has deliberately “engineered a famine” by obstructing the delivery of aid into Tigray.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo used to advance the claim has previously been used online to illustrate different reports not related to the food shortage currently being experienced in Ethiopia.
The image was published on the Taringa website in 2011 in an article titled, “Let’s reflect… Children of Africa die daily!!”
The image was also posted in a blog published on 9 December 2013 about the reality of the children of Africa. It was also shared on other websites, as seen here and here.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian people suffering due to the ‘artificial’ famine declared by the government and finds it to be FALSE.
