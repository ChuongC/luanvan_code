This Facebook post with an image claiming to show a woman who killed two children is FALSE.
The post in the Amharic text translates as; “The maid who killed two children in Bole Arabsa! She is taken into custody.”
This and this are similar claims with the same image.
On 1 September 2022, it was reported that a maid killed two children. “The police are investigating the murder of two children. The murder of two children in the Bole Arabsa condominium area of Addis Ababa’s Lami Kura district 4 happened at 4:00 am.”
But the image is not related to this incident, as Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo under investigation is old.
The image was shared on the ARABNEWS website on 5 August 2018 with the caption: “Ethiopian Federal Police officers detain a woman suspected to be carrying explosives during the welcoming ceremony of Jawar Mohammed, US-based Oromo activist and leader of the Oromo Protests, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on August 5, 2018.” The photo credit is given to REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri.
The same image was published on the Voice of America (VOA) website on 5 August 2018.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show a woman who killed two children and finds it to be FALSE.
