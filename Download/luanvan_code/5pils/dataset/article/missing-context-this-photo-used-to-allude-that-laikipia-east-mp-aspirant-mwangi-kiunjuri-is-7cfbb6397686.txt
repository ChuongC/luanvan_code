A Facebook post showing a photo and alluding that Laikipia East parliamentary aspirant, Mwangi Kiunjuri, is defecting to the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition is MISSING CONTEXT.
The photo was also shared here, here, and here.
Also in the photo shared on 15 June 2022, are the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya presidential running mate, Martha Karua, Kiunjuri, who leads The Service Party (TSP) and Nyeri senatorial aspirant, Kabando wa Kabando.
The post is captioned, “Martha Karua currently Meeting Mwangi Kiunjuri who is set to defect to Azimio la Umoja today!!’’
Kiunjuri, who was the Cabinet Secretary for Agriculture before he was relieved of duty by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2020, was cleared to run for the Laikipia East parliamentary seat on 30 May 2022. His TSP signed a deal to join the Kenya Kwanza coalition on 12 April 2022.
During a Kenya Kwanza rally in Nyandarua County in June 2022, Kiunjuri called on the Mt Kenya electorate to vote in leaders “from the central region in order to safeguard their interests”. He also urged his colleagues in the coalition to “emulate Azimio’s planning style”, which has made them popular at the grassroots level.
However, a Google reverse image search shows the photo was shared by Karua via her Twitter account on 11 February 2021, with the caption, “Having tea with friends.’’
Further, on 15 June 2022, Kiunjuri — through the TSP Twitter handle — urged the public to ignore the claim, saying the party has mechanisms of making such decisions.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post showing a photo and alluding that Laikipia East MP aspirant Mwangi Kiunjuri is defecting to the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition and finds it has been used MISSING CONTEXT.
