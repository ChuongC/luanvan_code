A photo of a Form Four History and Government textbook cover shared on Twitter, with photos of Azimio la Umoja — One Kenya presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his associates filing presidential election results petitions in 2017 and 2022 is satirical.
The cover shows pictures of Odinga and his allies carrying files and other documents used in their 2017 and 2022 presidential petitions.
The post suggests Odinga’s experiences — owing to the number of times he has challenged presidential election results — qualify to be included in the History and Government curriculum in secondary schools.
Odinga has vied for the presidency five times and has challenged the presidential election results three times.
In 2013, he filed a petition at the Supreme Court, which was dismissed. In 2017, he filed another petition, which led to the nullification of the August presidential election results.
He has filed another petition challenging the result of the 9 August 2022 poll, where William Ruto was declared president-elect.
We did a reverse image search of the cover and established that it had been edited from the original copy.
The original image of the cover has only one photo of Odinga taking an oath, while the other images are of former Kenyan President, the late Mwai Kibaki, and historical buildings in the country.
PesaCheck has examined a photo of a History and Government textbook cover shared on Twitter, with photos of Azimio la Umoja — One Kenya presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his associates filing presidential petition results in 2017 and 2022 and finds it to be satirical.
