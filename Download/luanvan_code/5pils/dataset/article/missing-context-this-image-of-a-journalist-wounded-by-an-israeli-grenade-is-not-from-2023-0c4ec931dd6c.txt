This Facebook post with an image of a journalist purportedly wounded by an Israeli grenade in 2023 is MISSING CONTEXT.
The post reads, “Journalist Hana Mahameed back on screen after being hit in face by an ISRA/ELI GRENADE in East Jersualem Was Hamas hiding in her face (sic)?”
The image depicts what seems to be a television screen featuring a woman reporting on air, with a portion of her face and kneck bandaged.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 50 journalists and media workers have been confirmed dead, with 11 reported injured and three others missing in the ongoing Hamas-Israel conflict.
A reverse image search on Microsoft Bing established that the image shared in the wake of the war is old.
The image was featured in an article dated 5 October 2015 with the headline, “Journalist Hana Mahameed back on screen after being hit in face by ‘Israeli grenade’ in East Jerusalem.”
According to the article, the Arab-Israeli reporter for Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV “returned to work with her face bandaged after being hit by a projectile reportedly fired during a clash between Israeli police and demonstrators in East Jerusalem.”
The Guardian shared a video of the incident in their reportage of Mahameed’s ordeal with the headline, “Arab-Israeli TV journalist goes back on air after being hit by stun grenade.”
