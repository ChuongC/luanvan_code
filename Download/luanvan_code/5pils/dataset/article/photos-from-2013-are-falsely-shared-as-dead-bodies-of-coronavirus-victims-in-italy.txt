A photo is being shared on Facebook with the claim that it shows the dead bodies of Coronavirus victims lined up in Italy. Let’s  analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of dead bodies of Coronavirus victims in Italy.
Fact: The image shows coffins containing the dead bodies of Lampedusa shipwreck victims. In 2013, a boat packed with around 500 African migrants caught fire and sank around half a mile from the Italian island Lampedusa leading to the death of more than 300 people. So, the claim isFALSE.   
When the image is subjected to reverse image search technique, it was found in an article of ‘The Guardian’. The image had the following description with it- ‘EU delegates, including José Manuel Barroso, pay tribute before rows of coffins containing the bodies of Lampedusa shipwreck victims’. As per the article, in October 2013, a boat packed with around 500 African migrants caught fire and sank around half a mile from the Italian island Lampedusa leading to the death of more than 300 people. So, the image is 6 years old and has nothing to do with the recent Coronavirus outbreak in Italy.
Italy is facing a severe crisis due to COVID-19. The country has till now recorded about 75,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 7,500 deaths.
To conclude, old images from 2013 are being falsely shared as ‘Dead bodies of Coronavirus victims in Italy’.
To conclude, ‘Mustard Oil’ has many health benefits but using it will not prevent a person from getting infected with Coronavirus.
