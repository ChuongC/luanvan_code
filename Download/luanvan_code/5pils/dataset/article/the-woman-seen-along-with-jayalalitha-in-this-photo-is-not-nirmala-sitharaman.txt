A black and white image of two women is doing rounds on social media with a claim that the women in the photo are former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalitha and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalitha with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
Fact: In the image, the woman seen along with Jayalalitha is not Nirmala Sitharaman; she is Tamil author Sivasankari. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. 
When the image is subjected to reverse image search technique, a Facebook post with the same image is found. In the post, the user wrote that the two women in the photo are Jayalalitha and Tamil writer Sivasankari. Also, the Tamil news website ‘Vikatan’ published the same photo in an article about Jayalalitha’s friends and in the article, the name of Sivasankari can be found. When you go through the old images of Sivasankari and Nirmala Sitharaman, it can be confirmed that the women on the right in the image is Tamil writer Sivasankari and not Nirmala Sitharaman as is being claimed.
To sum it up, the woman seen along with Jayalalitha in the photo is not Nirmala Sitharaman; she is Tamil writer Sivasankari.
