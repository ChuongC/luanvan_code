Old image shared as ‘imprisoned woman breastfeeding her baby through a fence at a detention centre in Banaras (Varanasi)’ - FACTLY

A screenshot with a photo is being widely shared on Facebook with the claim that it shows an imprisoned woman breastfeeding her baby through a fence at a detention centre in Banaras (Varanasi). It is also claimed that the woman was arrested for protesting against the National Register of Citizens (NRC). 
Claim: : Image of a woman imprisoned for protesting against NRC breastfeeding her baby at a detention centre in Banaras (Varanasi).
Fact: The image is on the internet at least since January 2013. So, it is in no way connected to NRC. Hence, the claim is FALSE.
When the image in the post is subjected to reverse image search technique, a Facebook post with the same image was found. The post was made in May 2013 with a different claim. In the comments section of that post, a user had posted an article of a news website that had the same image as seen in the post. The article was published on January 13, 2013, and the information in the article suggested that the image is from Argentina. ‘FACTLY’ wasn’t able to verify if the image is from Argentina or not, as no other information was available regarding the image. But, as the image is in circulation since 2013, it can be concluded that it has nothing to do with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) protests in India.
To conclude, the images of Policemen holding placards of ‘NO NRC NO CAA’ are photoshopped.
