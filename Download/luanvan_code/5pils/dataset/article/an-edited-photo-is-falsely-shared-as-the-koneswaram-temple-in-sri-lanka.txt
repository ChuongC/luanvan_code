Photo of a temple located on the narrow vertical island is being shared on social media claiming it as the Koneswaram temple located at Trincomalee in Sri Lanka. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Koneswaram temple located on a narrow island in Trincomalee, Sri Lanka.
Fact: It is an edited photo. The island in the photo located in Ao Phang Nga National Park in Thailand. Unrelated pictures of a temple, devotees and this island are edited and shared as the Koneswaram temple in Sri Lanka. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On searching ‘Koneswaram temple in Sri Lanka’ on Google, we found both the outside and inside view of Koneswaram temple in ‘All About Sri Lanka’ website. We also found a video on YouTube, showcasing the overall view of Koneswaram Temple located at Trincomalee in Sri Lanka. In both these sources, Koneswaram temple outside view is not the same as shown in the post.
On observing the Google Earth view of Koneswaram temple, we can conclude that the temple in the photo is not Koneswaram temple belonging to Sri Lanka, since this temple is not surrounded by water on all sides.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar photo of an island was found in ‘Alamy’ website. In the website, it is mentioned as the island located in Ao Phang Nga National Park in Thailand. A similar photo of the island found in ‘TripAdvisor’ website, mentioning as the island in Ao Phang Nga National Park.
To sum it up, an edited photo is falsely shared as the Koneswaram temple in Sri Lanka.
