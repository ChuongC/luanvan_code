A Facebook post with an image purportedly showing a Nigerian, who joined President-elect William Ruto’s legal team is FALSE.
The post reads: “Just in. Nigerian Igbo man lands in Nairobi to join UDA defense legal team. . all in all Baba won.”
On 26 August 2022, Ruto’s Kenya Kwanza coalition unveiled a team of 54 lawyers and five technical assistants to battle the election petitions challenging his 9 August election victory at the country’s Supreme Court. The Nigerian in the claim is, however, not one of them.
A reverse search on TinEye shows that the image in question is an old one and is unrelated to Kenya. The image was featured in a Nigerian blog on 7 February 2018.
According to the blog, the man was a fake barrister identified as Chris Elisha, who had been practising law for 15 years undetected.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with an image purportedly showing a Nigerian, who joined President-elect William Ruto’s legal team and finds it to be FALSE.
