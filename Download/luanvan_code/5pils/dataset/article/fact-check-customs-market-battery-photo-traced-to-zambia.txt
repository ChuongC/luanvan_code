South Sudan Exposed, a South Sudanese online publication, posted on its Facebook a picture claiming it was taken in Custom, a market in the South Sudan capital, Juba city.
The post was captioned ‘somewhere in Custom market’ by South Sudan Exposed, which writes on various news in the whole country with 9,400 likes and over 10,000 followers on Facebook. 
The post with the picture allegedly taken at the Customs market portrays fake batteries sold as new in the Custom Market.

Investigation:
On doing a Reverse Image Search on Google, the 211 Check team found that this image was first reported in Zambia by a local online news organisation named Zambia Report. 
According to the Zambia Report Facebook page, the batteries are sold at Matero – Lusaka, Zambia.
We could not track down any reputable news outlets that reported on the alleged incident.

Conclusion:
The claim that a battery photo was taken in Customs Market is false. A Google reverse image search shows that the image originated from Zambia, not the Juba Customs market.
