A photo of a couple is being widely shared on social media with a claim that it was taken recently at the Shaheen Bagh protests. Letâ€™s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim:  Intimate photo of a couple from the Shaheen Bagh protests.
Fact: The photo was found to be on the internet at least since March 2018. But, the protests at the Shaheen Bagh began in December 2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the image was run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found to be tweeted by a user on Twitter in March 2018. But, the Shaheen Bagh protests against CAA (Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019) began in December 2019, after the passage of the bill by the Parliament.
To sum it up, an old unrelated image falsely shared as the intimate photo of a couple from the Shaheen Bagh protests.
