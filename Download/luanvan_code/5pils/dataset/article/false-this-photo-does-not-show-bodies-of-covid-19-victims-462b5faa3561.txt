A Facebook post with a photo claiming to show bodies of COVID-19 victims is FALSE.
Screenshot of the Facebook post.
A Google reverse image search shows that the photo was published by the Associated Press (AP), a US-based news agency, on December 30, 2004 showing the aftermath of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami in Thailand.
The photo shows victims of the tsunami, which was triggered by an earthquake off the coast of Indonesia, which resulted in over 225,000 fatalities across South and Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, and the Maldives.
The post was published in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a number of lockdowns and movement restrictions across the world. As of April 27, 2020, Johns Hopkins University reported at least 206,000 COVID-19 deaths and over 2.9 million confirmed cases globally.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a photo claiming to show dead bodies of COVID-19 victims and finds it to be FALSE.
