An image posted to Facebook claiming to show President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton not wearing masks is used out of context and is MISLEADING.
The post, with an apparent screenshot of a tweet, shows the president, his wife and Ms Clinton all in a jovial mood, and flanked by onlookers. The text in the tweet claims that the two leaders only wear masks for the cameras.
However, an online image search shows that the photo dates back to July, 2016, and is not recent as claimed in the screenshot. The image was taken at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, when Ms Clinton was running for president.
The image is also available on the former Secretary of Stateâ€™s Flickr account and confirms that it was taken years before the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Additionally, the photograph of President Biden, First Lady Jill Biden, Ms Clinton and her husband Bill, in close proximity without face masks has been debunked by other fact-checking organizations, such as CheckYourFact, Reuters FactCheck and AP FactCheck.
PesaCheck has looked into an image posted on Facebook claiming to show President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, not wearing face masks and finds it was taken out of context and is MISLEADING.
