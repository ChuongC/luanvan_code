A Facebook post accompanied with an image claiming that a helicopter carrying President Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana was involved in a plane crash is FALSE.
A statement issued by the Government of Botswana on 20 July 2019, the day of the incident, showed that the Botswana Defence Forces aircraft carrying the president did not crash land as claimed, but had to make an emergency precautionary landing in Francistown.
“The office of the President and the BDF wishes to inform the public that a BDF presidential helicopter carrying His Excellency was forced to make an immediate precautionary landing while taxiing at Francistown airport upon arrival from Mathangwane at 1730hrs today 20th July 2019,” the statement said.
The precautionary landing was made necessary by an engine fire as the helicopter carrying the president travelled to Francistown, Botswana’s second-largest city, from Mathangwane, a village in the Central District of Botswana.
“The pilots reported an engine fire indication, whereupon they promptly executed an engine shut down and landing on runway 13 at the airport,’’ the statement added. “All five passengers and three crew members were safe and without injuries.”
A reverse image search of the photo accompanying the Facebook post reveals that that it is from a video of a helicopter crash on July 15, 2019, in Hayward Bay Area in California, USA in which a flight instructor was killed and a student was critically injured.
Following the incident, President Masisi ordered an investigation into the cause of the engine fire, the actions of the ground staff and air crews, and all other circumstances surrounding the incident.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi was involved in a plane crash and has found ths to be FALSE.
