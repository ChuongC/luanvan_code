This Facebook post with an image claiming to show flooding that has claimed the lives of 134 people in Sudan since May 2022 is PARTLY FALSE.
The accompanying Amharic text translates as; “The number of people who died in the floods in Sudan rose to 134. Following the severe flood in Sudan, the death toll has reached 134 and many houses have been destroyed. Last week alone, 20 people died in Sudan in a flood, according to Sudanese authorities. This brings the number of people who have died in Sudan since the flooding started in May to 134, CGTN reported. The head of the Sudan Civil Defence National Council, Brigadier General Abdul Jalil Abdul Rahim, said that in addition to those who died in the flood, 120 people were injured.”
However, Google reverse image search results show that the image dates to 2019.
The photo was shared on this website on 15 August 2019 to show flood victims in Sudan. Similarly, this website shared the image in an article, “UN: Over 50 thousand people were affected by torrential rain and flood in Sudan.”
On 17 September 2022, CGTN reported that the death toll from floods in Sudan had reached 134. Also, Alarabiya News’ report indicated that the flooding could affect up to 460,000 people this year.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show flooding in which 134 people have died in Sudan since May 2022 and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
