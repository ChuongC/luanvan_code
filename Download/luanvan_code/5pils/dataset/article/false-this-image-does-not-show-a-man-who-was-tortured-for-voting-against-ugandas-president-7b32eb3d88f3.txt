A Twitter post showing an image of a man with back injuries and a claim that this was meted out as punishment for voting against Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni, is FALSE.
Text accompanying the image reads in part, “…just because we voted for CHANGE you branded us TERRORISTS. Subjecting us to torture, abduction and death”, and also includes unsubstantiated accusations about the killing of youth in Buganda.
The post was published on February 14, 2021, exactly a month after Ugandans went to the polls. Dozens of people lost their lives in election-related violence in the period leading up to the poll, with opposition leaders accusing the government of harassment.
President Museveni was declared winner by the Electoral Commission after securing 58 percent of the vote while National Unity Platform’s (NUP) presidential candidate, Robert Kyagulanyi, came second with 34 percent, results he contested.
A reverse image search shows that it was taken in The Republic of Guinea and published on March 1, 2020 in Couleur Guinee, a Guinean news site. The man in the photo has been identified as Alpha Oumar Diallo, an 18-year-old merchant who was injured during protests in Conakry by Guinea’s opposition against President Alpha Conde’s government.
PesaCheck also debunked a similar claim here.
PesaCheck has looked into a claim that an image showing a torture victim with back lacerations claiming it was taken in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
