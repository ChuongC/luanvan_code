This Facebook post with an image purportedly of recycled condoms for sale seized from Moi University students in Kenya is FALSE.
The post reads: “HARD NEWS; Kenya making INTERNATIONAL HEADLINES…..CHECK OUT! [] In Kenya[] city of ELdoret, 6 Moi University students reportedly arrested after being found washing and re-packaging USED condoms and re-selling them to unsuspecting club revellers.”
The image has a watermark at the bottom reading: “Binh Duong’s market management d”. Binh Duong is a Vietnamese province.
A Google reverse image search established that the image was featured in an article dated 22 September 2020 with the headline, “Police bust condom recycling facility in southern Vietnam”.
According to the article, more than 300,000 used condoms that had been washed and were being packaged for sale to the public as “new” were discovered by Vietnamese police during a raid.
Video evidence of the Vietnamese police raid is in this report by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), uploaded on 25 September 2020.
The title reads, “Recycled condom business raided by Vietnamese police”.
There is no evidence from a reliable source that such an arrest was made in Eldoret, Kenya.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly of recycled condoms for sale seized from Moi University students and finds it to be FALSE.
