A tweet with an image claiming to show a security blockade outside Kenya’s outgoing Deputy President William Ruto’s home is FALSE.
The picture shows armed security officials standing guard and wearing bullet-proof vests and helmets.
“Right now, outside Ruto’s home. He’s been put under preventive arrest. The road to his home is blocked,” the tweet accompanying the image reads.
A reverse image search reveals the photo was neither taken in Kenya nor at the home of DP Ruto as claimed. Among the search results is an article by Eagle Online containing the image.
The 3 May 2016 article is about the house arrest of Ugandan politician and human rights activist Kizza Besigye. The caption of the accompanying image is about the police blocking Besigye’s house in Kasangati.
PesaCheck has examined the image claiming to show a security blockade outside Kenya’s outgoing Deputy President William Ruto’s home and found it to be FALSE.
