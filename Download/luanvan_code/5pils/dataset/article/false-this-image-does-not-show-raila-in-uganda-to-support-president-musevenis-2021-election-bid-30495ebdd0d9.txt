A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Raila Odinga in Kampala to support President Yoweri Museveni ahead of Uganda’s 2021 general election is FALSE.
The image shows Raila reaching out to shake hands with a man on his right as he follows President Museveni down the aisle of a conference hall.
However, a reverse image search of the photo reveals that the image is not recent and has been used before. The image was taken in September 2019 at a Public Private Partnership Conference held at Kampala Serena Hotel.
Raila Odinga, Kenya’s former prime minister, participated in the conference which brings together African experts to discuss solutions that can help bridge development gaps on the continent with a focus on funding infrastructure development. Mr Odinga currently serves as the High Representative for Infrastructure Development in Africa at the African Union Commission.
Mr Odinga’s official Twitter account, which provides updates on events he participates in, has no information about him visiting Uganda recently.
PesaCheck has looked into the post claiming to show Raila Odinga in Kampala ahead of Uganda’s general election to support President Yoweri Museveni and finds them to be FALSE.
