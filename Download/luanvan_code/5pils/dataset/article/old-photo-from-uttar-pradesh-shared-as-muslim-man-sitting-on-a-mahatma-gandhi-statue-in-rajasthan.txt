The ‘Vishwas News’ fact-check team contacted Dainik Jagran’s Amethi reporter Dilip Singh for more clarification regarding the photo. Speaking to the ‘Vishwas News’, Dilip Singh said, “This picture was taken during Bharat Milaap at Gandhi Chowk in Amethi. When a lot of crowd was present there, one person from the crowd sat on Mahatma Gandhi’s statue. There is no communal angle in the viral picture”.
