This Facebook post with images contrasting a 2016 pro-refugee protest supposedly in France with the 2023 riots in the country is PARTLY FALSE.
“I see that worked out great for them. France 2016 vs 2023,” the post reads.
The claim was published after a wave of protests swept France following the shooting of a 17-year-old teenager by a police officer in Nanterre, Paris. The claim appears to blame the protests on refugees in France.
We performed a reverse image search on Yandex and established that the top image with a banner reading: “They are not dangerous, they are in danger! Refugees welcome” was taken in 2015 in Brussels, Belgium.
The image was featured in a 27 September 2015 article with the headline: 15,000 join “Refugees Welcome” solidarity march in Brussels.

The second image is from the recent protests in France and depicts firefighters extinguishing burning vehicles during the riots. The credit is to Reuters photographer Stephanie Lecocq.
