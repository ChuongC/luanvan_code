A photo shared on Facebook claiming to show Orange Suba South member of parliament John Mbadi being chased away by an angry mob on October 30, 2020, in Mombasa is FALSE.
The photo captures MP Mbadi running with three other men, who also appear to be in flight, behind him.
The post says the MP, who serves as both the minority leader in Kenya’s National Assembly and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) chair, was championing for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) when angry residents turned against him.
The BBI report was relaunched at the Bomas of Kenya on October 26. The initiative — the brainchild of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr Odinga — was conceived in March 2018, in the famous “Handshake” agreement, that ended months of post-election demonstrations that had seen dozens killed by the police.
However, the photo in the post doesn’t show MP Mbadi being chased away from a rally by an angry mob in Mombasa on October 30.
A reverse image search reveals that the photo has been online since January 2018. The photo seems to have been taken in Nairobi when the National Super Alliance (NASA) MPs were demanding the release of Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang.
The photo was also published by the Star newspaper on January 31, 2018, and captioned: Suba MP John Mbadi runs for his life after anti-riot police officers threw teargas canisters outside Nairobi PCIO . The photo is credited to Luke Awich.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo claiming to show MP John Mbadi running away from an angry mob in Mombasa on October 30, 2020 and finds it to be FALSE.
