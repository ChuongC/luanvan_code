A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a missile attack on the largest fuel depot of the Ukrainian military by Russian troops is FALSE.
The post that contains an image of a missile reads, “Russia’s military has used Iskander ballistic missile to destroy the largest fuel depot of Ukrainian military outside Keiv (sic). It was said to be the last remaining Ukrainian military in the area.”
Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, but its forces withdrew from around the capital Kyiv and surrounding regions to Belarus and western Russia in early April.
On the evening of 24 March 2022, Russia reportedly destroyed the largest remaining military fuel storage site in Ukraine, attacking it with Kalibr cruise missiles.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photos used to support the claim are not related to the 2022 Ukraine and Russia conflict.
The Difesa Online website published the picture on 16 April 2016 in the article, “Russia, Iskander Missile Launched, Radars did not detect it.”
The image was also posted on the Lragir website on 10 August 2015 alongside an article titled, “Russia Won’t Sell Iskander to Everyone But Will it Sell It to Azerbaijan?”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a missile attack on the largest fuel depot of the Ukrainian military by Russian troops and finds it to be FALSE.
