An image shared on Facebook claiming to show a victim of an airstrike in Tigray in January 2022 is FALSE.
“Reuters reports, quoting aid workers, local officials, and eyewitnesses, indicate that at least 17 people were killed on Monday in an airstrike by the Federal government in Mai Tsebri, Tigray region. Most of the victims were women and many people were injured,” part of the Amharic post says.
Reuters indeed reported that on 10 January 2022 there was an airstrike in Mai Tsebri, the Tigray region. As a result of the attack at least 17 people were killed, the media house reported.
The war in the Tigray region erupted in November 2020 after an alleged attack on the Ethiopian National Defence Force Northern Command by the Tigray Forces.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo used to support the claim does not show a victim of the air strikes in Tigray of Ethiopia in January 2022.
The image was shared on the US News and World Report website on 23 June 2021. It was taken when a victim of an airstrike in a village called Togoga, which is found in the Tigray region, arrived in an ambulance at the Ayder Referral Hospital. Image credit is given to the Associated Press.
