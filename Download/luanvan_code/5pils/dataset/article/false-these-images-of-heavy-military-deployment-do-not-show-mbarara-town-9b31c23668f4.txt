A Facebook post claiming to show images of heavy military and police deployment in Mbarara is FALSE.
The post claims to show images of heavy military deployment on the streets of Mbarara along with the claim that it showed the situation in the town at that moment.
The photographs were shared on November 5, a day before presidential aspirant Robert Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine, launched the manifesto of his National Unity Platform party in Mabara town ahead of the 2021 elections.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the images were not taken in Mbarara town as claimed in the post. The images showing heavy military deployment were first shared in July 2014 after Ugandan police stepped up security in Kampala following the threat of a terrorist attack.
The images featured in multiple stories by the BBC as seen here and here and accompanied reports that troops had been deployed to the airport and in the city of Kampala.
On 7th November 2020, Mr Kyagulanyi launched the manifesto of the National Unity platform, a party he leads and on whose ticket he is vying for the presidency in Ugandaâ€™s 2021 elections.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show images of heavy military and police deployment in Mbarara town and finds it to be FALSE.
