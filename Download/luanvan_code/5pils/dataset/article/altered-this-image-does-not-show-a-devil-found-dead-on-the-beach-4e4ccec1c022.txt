A Facebook image of a massive creature lying on a beach with what looks like an ocean behind it and a crowd of people in the foreground is ALTERED.
The post is captioned: “Finally the devil found dead on the beach of the Pacific Ocean. Now the world can live at peace.”
However, a Google reverse search reveals that this image originates from 2016, with a different claim that the creature was washed ashore in Mexico.
On June 1, 2016, the website NetLiveMedia published an article that a “mysterious 4-metre long sea monster” was washed ashore in Mexico.
The photograph had a strong resemblance to the “Montauk Monster” of 2008, down to the distinctive facial feature and creases in the creature’s flesh. The Montauk Monster refers to a carcass that was supposedly found and photographed by three women in July 2008 on a beach in Montauk, New York.
As it turns out, the primary image in this digital manipulation has been used in several older marine hoaxes.
Another reverse image search led us to a photo of a dead whale that beached at Maule on the Gulf of Arauco in Chile, in November 2011. The photo is credited to Reuters news agency and was taken by Jose Luis Saavedra.
The image in the claim is actually a fabrication that merged the photo of the dead whale found in Chile in 2011 with a picture of a Montauk Monster.
PesaCheck has looked into a post with an image showing a massive creature lying on a beach with what appears to be an ocean behind it and a crowd of people in the foreground and finds it to be ALTERED.
