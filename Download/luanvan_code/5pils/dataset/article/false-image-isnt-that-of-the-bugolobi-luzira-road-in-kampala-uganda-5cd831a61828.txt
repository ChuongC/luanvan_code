This tweet with a photo purportedly of an aerial view of the Bugolobi-Luzira road in Uganda’s capital Kampala is FALSE.
The text accompanying the image reads: “An aerial view of the road from Bugolobi to Luzira.”
The said road is four kilometres from Kampala and connects the city centre with the Bugolobi and Luzira industrial areas where a number of companies, including manufacturers of plastics, pharmaceuticals and Uganda Breweries, are located.
Notably, a search using Google Lens showed that this picture is not of Bugolobi-Luzira road, but it was taken in Madhubani district, Bihar, India.
In an article published by The Hindustan Gazette in India, the road is described as the National Highway 227 and is said to have more than 100 potholes.
The picture is attributed to journalist Praveen Thakur of Dainik Bhaskar, a Hindi language daily newspaper.
A search on the internet shows it was first published on 21 June 2022, when the journalist posted the video on his Twitter account.
There is also a video of the road published by NDTV, a television station in India. The broadcaster also attributes it to Thakur.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with a photo claiming to be of an aerial view of the Bugolobi-Luzira road in Uganda’s capital, Kampala, and found it to be FALSE.
