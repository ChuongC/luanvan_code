A photo is being shared widely on Facebook with a claim that it shows the status of a detention camp in Assam. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post
Claim: Status of a detention camp in Assam. 
Fact: The photo is in circulation for the last one and a half year with the description that it is related to a prison in La Romana. So, it is not related to any detention camp in Assam. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the image in the post was run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in an article by ‘eltiempo’. In the article, the photo had the following description: ‘Presos en preventiva La Romana’ (English Translation: ‘Prisoners in preventive La Romana’). When searched with the Spanish keywords, the same photo was found to be in circulation on Facebook from April 2018. 
Many users have posted other similar photos and videos claiming them to be related to ‘La Romana Preventive Jail’. No news reports or older posts were found linking the posted photo to the detention camps in Assam. While there is no authentic source to prove that the posted photo is related to La Romana, it is definitely not related to the detention camp in Assam.
To sum it up, the photo is not related to any detention camp in Assam.
