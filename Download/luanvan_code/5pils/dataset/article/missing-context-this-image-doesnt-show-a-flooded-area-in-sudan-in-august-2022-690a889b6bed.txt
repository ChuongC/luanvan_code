A Facebook post image claiming to show a flooded area in Sudan in August 2022 is MISSING CONTEXT.
The post in Amharic shared on 20 August 2022 translates in part as; “Flooding disaster in Sudan completely destroyed about nine thousand houses and damaged about 27 thousand houses. Many areas in Sudan have been affected by heavy rains and floods. This week alone, 77 Sudanese were reportedly swept away by floods in the Blue Nile region of the country.”
The post adds: “CGTN reported that about 9,000 houses were completely destroyed and 27,000 houses were damaged. According to the report, other public facilities including schools were destroyed in the disaster.”
Al Jazeera reported that flooding in Sudan has killed scores of people and destroyed an estimated 14,500 homes as seasonal rains pound the country, causing rivers to flood and destroy property.
However, Google reverse image search results say otherwise. The image is old and is not related with the recent flooding in Sudan.
The original image shows “people walk in flood water in Wad Ramli village on the eastern banks of the Nile river, 50km north of Khartoum, on 26 August 2019…” The image is credited to Ebrahim Hamid/AFP via Getty Images.
According to the post, the CGTN reported that about 9,000 houses were completely destroyed and 27,000 houses were damaged.
However, the claim is unfounded. A review of the CGTN website provides no content on the said flood in Sudan in August 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into an image of a Facebook post claiming to show a flooded area in Sudan in August 2022 and finds it to be MISSING CONTEXT.
