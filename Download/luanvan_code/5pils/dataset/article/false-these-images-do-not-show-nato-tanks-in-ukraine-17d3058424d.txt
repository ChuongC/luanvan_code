These images used to advance a claim that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) tanks arrived in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, to fight the Russian invasion are FALSE.
The post, written in English and published on Facebook, reads, “First NATO tanks arrive in Kyiv to fight Russia.”
NATO is an alliance of twenty-eight European and two North American countries formed after World War II. The alliance members include the United States, most European Union members, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Turkey.
On 25 February 2022, NATO released a statement opposing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and added that “the Alliance has operationally aligned its maritime, land, air, space, and cyber forces to defend our NATO sovereignty”.
However, Google’s reverse image search results here and here reveal that the images in the claim do not show NATO tanks in Kyiv.
The Daily Mail news website published the first image on 13 May 2017. Its description says, “London’s Gay Pride march in 1995. Peter Ackroyd subtitles his book ‘gay life in London from the Romans to the present day’”.
The second image was published on the IndyMedia UK website on 1 September 2005. “The Amnesty International Pink Tank On Patrol,” its description reads.
PesaCheck has looked into images shared on Facebook claiming to show NATO tanks in Ukrainian capital Kyiv to fight the Russian invasion and find it to be FALSE.
