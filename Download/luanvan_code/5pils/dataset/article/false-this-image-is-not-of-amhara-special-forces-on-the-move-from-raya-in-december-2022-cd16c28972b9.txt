A Facebook post with an image purportedly of Amhara Special Forces leaving Raya in northern Ethiopia is FALSE.
“Amhara regional state special security forces including the special forces have been removed from the surroundings of Raya,” reads the Amharic text posted on 10 January 2023.
The post further states: “Amhara Demits reported that the special security forces were forcibly leaving Raya areas named Garjale, Tako and Ber.”
The special forces, according to the post, were deployed in Alamata, Kobo and Sekota while the federal forces have overtaken the Raya.
The post is accompanied by an image of armed military personnel on the move.
Raya is among the disputed areas between Amhara and Tigray regional states in northern Ethiopia.
Reuters reported that Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) began surrendering their weapons to the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) on 10 January 2023. The handover is in line with article 6 of the Pretoria Peace Agreement concluded between the Ethiopian government and TPLF on 2 November 2022, which seeks to bring peace to the region.
However, the image we are investigating isn’t of Amhara Special Forces withdrawing from Raya in January 2023, as claimed.
Google reverse image search results indicate that the image has been online since March 2022.
In March 2022, this website shared the photo in a report claiming that more than 400 ethnic Amhara soldiers were detained in Debre Tabor, western Amhara, due to disagreement with the regional government. Similarly, the image was shared here, with a similar description in the same period.
PesaCheck has looked into a post that claims to show Amhara Special Forces on the move from Raya in January 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
