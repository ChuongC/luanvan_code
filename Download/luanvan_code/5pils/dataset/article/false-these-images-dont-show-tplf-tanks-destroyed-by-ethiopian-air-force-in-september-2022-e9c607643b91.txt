This Facebook post with images claiming to show two tanks belonging to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces destroyed by the Ethiopian Air Force while on the way to Kobo is FALSE.
The post, in Afaan Oromo and shared on 14 September 2022, names Alamata ball field as the place where TPLF were taking the alleged tanks.
“The heroic Ethiopian Air Force destroyed, with an air attack, two tanks which the terrorist group TPLF was taking to Kobo in a place called Alamata ball field,” the text reads.
The post is accompanied by two images of a drone and the wreckage of the weapon.
There have been reports of renewed fighting between TPLF and federal government forces around the town of Kobo since the resumption of war on 24 August 2022. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced since the conflict started in late 2020.
However, the claimed images do not show Tigray forces destroyed in September 2022, as seen here, and here.
The first image shows SkyGuardian, “a new variant of the Predator B drone that meets international civilian airspace requirements on 30 January 2017”. The image credit is courtesy of GA-ASI.
The second image shows a Russian armoured infantry carrier destroyed by Ukrainian forces in May 2022. Defense Express also published this image.
PesaCheck has investigated a Facebook post with images claiming to show two TPLF tanks destroyed by the Ethiopian Air Force around Kobo in September 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
