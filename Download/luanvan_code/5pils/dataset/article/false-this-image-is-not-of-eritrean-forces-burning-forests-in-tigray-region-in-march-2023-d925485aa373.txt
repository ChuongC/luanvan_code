This image on Facebook claiming to be of Eritrean forces burning forests in Tigray in March 2023 is FALSE.
“Breaking news: A media called Tigray Today posted that the Eritrean forces are burning Tigray’s forests on both ends,” reads the post in Afaan Oromo. It is accompanied by an image.
On 20 January 2023, AP reported that area residents had seen Eritrean forces withdrawing from towns in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray, where they had been fighting alongside Ethiopia’s federal troops against rebels.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo in the claim is not related to Eritrean soldiers burning forests in Tigray.
The image was published on 27 March 2021 by BBC Amharic alongside an article titled, “The fire that is destroying parks and dense forests in the last two weeks.” According to the caption, the photo was taken during a wildfire outbreak in the Wof Washa forest in Amhara Region. The image is credited to Ankober Communication.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purporting to be of Eritrean forces burning forests in Tigray in March 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
