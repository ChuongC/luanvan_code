An image shared on Facebook showing United States President Joe Biden holding a T-shirt with Gifaataa New Year greetings printed on it, is ALTERED.
The Amharic text accompanying the image translates, “United States President, Joe Biden sending a message to Wolaita people saying Happy Gifaataa New Year”.
Gifaataa is an annual festival celebrated in September and is the New Year festival of the Wolaita people.
A Google reverse image search reveals that the picture purporting to show Biden holding a T-shirt with Gifaataa greetings printed on it doctored.
The original image shows Biden holding a jersey written “Biden 46’’. The photo was taken as Biden welcomed the Los Angeles Dodgers to the White House to celebrate their 2020 World Series win.
On 10 September 2021, Biden sent best wishes for the New Year to all the people of Ethiopia, Eritrea and everyone celebrating Enkutatash, which marks the first day on the Ethiopian calendar.
No reports on The White House website show that Biden made a statement regarding the Wolaita New year, Gifaataa.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook showing United States President Joe Biden holding a T-shirt with Gifaataa New Year greetings printed on it and finds it to be ALTERED.
