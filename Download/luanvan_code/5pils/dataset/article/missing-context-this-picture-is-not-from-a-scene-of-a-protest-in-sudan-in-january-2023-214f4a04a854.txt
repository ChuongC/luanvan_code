This Facebook post with an image purporting to show Sudanese protesters in January 2023 is MISSING CONTEXT.
The picture is accompanied by an Amharic text that translates to; “The Sudanese went out to the street again. Hundreds of Sudanese are protesting in the streets of Khartoum. The protestors were heard when they said that they do not accept the agreement made a week ago for the gradual resignation of the military government and when they called for the immediate resignation of the military regime.”
The post adds: “This rally which is led by the opposition committee announced that it will not accept any negotiations that will be made with Sudan’s military leaders. In Sudan, in September 2022, it is known that the military regime came to power in a coup that was led by Sudanese soldiers.”
While a protest was reported in Sudan, with demonstrators demanding the resignation of the military regime from power, results from TinEye reverse image search established that the picture under investigation is old.
Previously published on the Alamy website, the photo was taken on 10 February 2022. The caption reads: “Protesters march during a rally against military rule following the coup in Khartoum, Sudan, February 10, 2022.” The picture credit is Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah.
The same picture was used on the Reuters website on 28 February 2022 to advance an article with the title, “Sudanese protesters against military rule defy tear gas to reach palace gates.”
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image purporting to be of Sudanese protesters in January 2023 and found it to be MISSING CONTEXT.
