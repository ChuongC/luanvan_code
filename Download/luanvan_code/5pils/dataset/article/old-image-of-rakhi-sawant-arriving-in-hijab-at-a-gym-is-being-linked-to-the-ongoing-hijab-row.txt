A photo is being shared on social media claiming it as a recent picture of Bollywood actress Rakhi Sawant wearing a Hijab and expressing her solidarity towards the ongoing Hijab movement by Muslim students in Karnataka. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Rakhi Sawant wore a Hijab expressing her solidarity towards Muslim students fighting for Hijab in Karnataka.
Fact: The photo shared in the post is an old one. This photo was shot in August 2021 when Rakhi Sawant arrived in Hijab at a Gym. This photo has nothing to do with the ongoing Hijab row. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.

While interacting with media on her attire, Rakhi Sawant said that the hijab was gifted by one of her friends and said she was wearing gym attire underneath the hijab.
