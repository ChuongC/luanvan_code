A Facebook post claiming to show images of the military leaving Robert Kyagulanyi’s home in Magere, is FALSE.
The two images in the post, showing military troops in a truck, are accompanied by the claim that the move follows a High Court directive to leave the home of Mr Kyagulanyi, who is also known by his stage name Bobi Wine.
On January 25, 2021, the High Court in Kampala ordered the security to vacate the home of the National Unity Platform (NUP) leader in Magere, where he and his wife, Barbara Itungo, have been confined since January 14 when the presidential election was held.
But while the photos indeed show Ugandan security personnel atop military and police trucks, a Google reverse image search here and here reveals that they were taken in 2016 in Magere, and not 2021 as claimed.
The images have been featured in articles by Reuters and ABC News, and reported that the military had evacuated citizens after violence broke out in Juba at Nimule town, along the South Sudan and Uganda border, and not in Magere. Nimule is located in South Sudan, and lies north of the border with Uganda, while Magere is located in central Uganda.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show images of the military leaving Robert Kyagulanyi’s home in Magere, Uganda, and finds them to be FALSE.
