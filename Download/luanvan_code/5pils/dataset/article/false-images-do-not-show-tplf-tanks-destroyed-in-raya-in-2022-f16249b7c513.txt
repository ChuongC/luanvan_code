A Facebook post with images claiming to show four Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) tanks destroyed in the ongoing war at the Raya front is FALSE.
The translation of the Amharic post shared on 26 September 2022 is: “At the Raya front, four TPLF tanks have been rendered useless today,in addition to Yesterday.”
The four images show the wrecked military ware.
The Ethiopian government troops and TPLF have been at war since 2020 in the northern Tigray region. A ceasefire had been declared in March 2022 but the war resumed on 24 August 2022, with each side blaming the other for breaking the truce.
However, the images we are looking into do not show tanks belonging to Tigray forces destroyed in September 2022.
A Google reverse image search for the four images indicate they were taken on 7 December 2021, as seen here, here, here, and here.
​​The first image, according to our research, was captured by Reuters photographer Kumera Gemechu. The description says it is a photo of “a military tank destroyed recently during fighting between the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in Damot Kebele of Amhara region, Ethiopia.”
The second image is of ammunition seen “next to a tank destroyed in a fight between the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces in Kasagita town, Afar region, Ethiopia on 25 February 2022”. The image is credited to the Reuters photographer Tiksa Negeri.
The third image shows “a damaged tank standing on a road north of Mekele, the capital of Tigray in February 2021.” The image is credited to Eduardo Soteras/AFP/Getty Images.
The last image was captured by AFP photographer Eduardo Soteras on 22 November 2020. It shows a damaged tank standing abandoned on a road near Humera, Ethiopia.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show four tanks belonging to Tigray forces destroyed in the ongoing war at the Raya front and finds it to be FALSE.
