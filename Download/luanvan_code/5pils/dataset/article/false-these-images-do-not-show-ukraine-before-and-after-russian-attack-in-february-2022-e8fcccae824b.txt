Images shared on Facebook claiming to show Ukraine before and after the Russian attack in February 2022 is FALSE.
The post in Amharic shared on Facebook on 25 February 2022 translates: “Ukraine yesterday vs today”.
The post was shared a day after Russia commenced attack on Ukraine and compares Ukraine, before and after the invasion, in February 2022.
The post is accompanied by two images. The first showing a city with a monument at the center and captioned as “yesterday” in Amharic. The second picture also shows a similar image with damaged structures and captioned “today”, in Amharic.
Although the Russian army that invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022 advanced to the outskirts of Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, the city remained uncaptured by Putin’s troops on 28 February 2022.
According to a situation report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA), intensive fighting between Russia and Ukraine forces has caused severe humanitarian crises including 240 civilian casualties and displacement of over 160,000 Ukrainians.
However the claim that the images show Ukraine before and after the war in February 2022 is not true.
Reverse image results show that the first picture shows a general view of Independence Square in central Kyiv, Ukraine. The image was taken by Reuters photographer Valentyn Ogirenko on 25 February 2022.
The war commenced on 24 February 2022, a day after the conflict commenced and hence does not show Ukraine before the war.
Results of reverse image search for the second image also reveal the photo shows Independence Square in Kyiv, Ukraine in February 2014.
The image was captured by Reuters photographer Olga Yakimovich on 19 February 2014 and it shows an aerial view of the Square during clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces in central Kyiv on 19 February 2014.
The image does not show the situation in Ukraine after the war in February 2022, as claimed.
PesaCheck has investigated images shared on Facebook claiming to show Ukraine before and after the Russian attack in February 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
