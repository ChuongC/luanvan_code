This Facebook post claiming to show an image of Energy Cabinet Secretary, Charles Keter, launching grandmothers is MISLEADING.
In the image, CS Keter is seen in a gathering, standing beside a woman to his right and a man to his left. Keter is holding a pair of scissors in the photo, apparently in preparation for cutting a red ribbon in front of him, while two elderly women sit close by.
The photo was published with a caption “CS Keter launching grandmothers, alafu utaskia wengine ati Keter for governor, io ni upusi (and then you’ll hear others saying Keter for governor, that is hogwash)”.
The image has been shared again on Facebook here.
A reverse image search on Google reveals that the image was taken in July 2017, when the CS was in Belgut, Kericho County, launching the Inua Jamii Cash Transfer programme. The programme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
It is a strategic intervention by the Kenyan government to cushion the most vulnerable in society, including senior citizens, orphans and children as well as persons with disabilities to improve their livelihood.
According to local online publication Nairobi News, the image went viral back in 2017, as government officials went about launching different projects in the run-up to the 8 August 2017 general election.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show an image of Energy CS Charles Keter launching grandmothers and finds it to be MISLEADING.
