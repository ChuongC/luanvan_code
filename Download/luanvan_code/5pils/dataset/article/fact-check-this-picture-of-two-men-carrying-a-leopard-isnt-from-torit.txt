A Facebook post published by Juba Eye on 19 October 2023 allegedly of two people carrying a leopard in Torit is false.
Torit town is the state capital of Eastern Equatoria State.
“Fear no gangs spotted in Torit,” the post caption reads. One of the commentators replied, “This is Oguruny Village,” referring to a village in Eastern Equatoria, believing the picture was taken in Torit.
This post attracted 486 reactions, 83 comments and seven shares.

On 20 October 2023, it was shared on 9GAG by Random with the claim, “Just another day in a third-world country… living within our means”.
About a week ago, the picture was shared on LinkedIn by Bakheit Shata with the caption: “Maasai Tribe’s mother-in-law gift to Marriage [ their daughter] this is to approve as Man”
