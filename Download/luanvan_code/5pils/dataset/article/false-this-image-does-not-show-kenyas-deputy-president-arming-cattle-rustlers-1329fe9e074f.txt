An image shared on Facebook purporting to show Kenya’s Deputy President William Ruto handing over a gun to cattle rustlers is FALSE.
In the photo, DP Ruto is seen holding an AK-47 rifle as Josphat Nanok, the Turkana County governor, and other officials look on.
The text posted with the image refers to a viral video in which a man from Pokot purportedly said that “Ruto gave some rustlers 240 guns”. The photo is supposed to show the alleged handover.
The photo was also shared here, here and here alongside accusations that Ruto is fueling tribal animosity.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the photo was initially published alongside an article by The Standard, a Kenyan publication, on June 16, 2019.
The article is a commentary by Gabriel Dolan, a priest and human rights activist, about disarmament policies and their effectiveness in addressing the problem of banditry and cattle rustling in pastoralists communities as well as gang crimes in urban and rural areas.
The caption of the image says that the DP was photographed during a past disarmament exercise in Turkana in 2015.
The DP also posted the image in question on his Twitter handle in 2015 alongside other images showing the said disarmament program. Dr Ruto accompanied the photo with a post ‘Registration of firearms in Turkana to establish those holding them. Rogue handlers will be disarmed.’
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming to show Kenya’s Deputy President William Ruto handing over a gun to cattle rustlers, and finds it is FALSE.
