This tweet claiming to show a drone attack on Kombolcha town in the Oromia region of Ethiopia by government forces in November 2022 is FALSE.
“Abiy’s (PM Abiy) drone is striking Kombolcha town in Horo Guduru of Oromia today. Kombolcha is a densely populated town in the area,” the post says.
Kombolcha is one of the Oromia districts.
Reports indicate that airstrikes killed dozens of civilians in Mendi, West Wollega, Oromia, on 9 November 2022.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the image is not related to Ethiopia.
The image was published on The Drive website on 12 July 2022 with the caption: “An Iranian Ababil-series armed unmanned aerial vehicle during a military drill held in Semnan, Iran in January 2021.” The photo is credited to the Iranian Army/Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image purportedly of a drone attack on Kombolcha town in the Oromia region by the Ethiopian government forces in November 2022, and finds it to be FALSE.
