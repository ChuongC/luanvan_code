An image shared on Facebook claiming to show a yellow cross mounted on a building at State House, Nairobi, is ALTERED.
The image shows the front porch of the State House with the yellow cross mounted on the roof.
Behind the cross is the presidential standard (flag) of President William Ruto.
PesaCheck ran the image through Fotoforensics, which confirmed that the photo had been altered.
A reverse image search also shows that the original image does not contain the cross.
The search results include a link to State House’s Twitter account containing the image set as the display image.
The image is of the presidential standard and the East African Community (EAC) flag.
The cover image is a wider shot of State House, revealing the Kenyan flag on the other wing of the building.
The same images have also been uploaded on Kenya’s State House Facebook page.
PesaCheck has examined the image shared on Facebook claiming to show State House in Nairobi, Kenya, containing a yellow cross and finds it to be ALTERED.
