An image purporting to show Kenya’s deputy president, William Ruto, kneeling on a church pew next to a gun is ALTERED.
The Facebook image post does not, however, indicate when or where the photo was taken.
The image caption reads, “A gun on one hand and a Bible on the other, that is how our forefathers lost their freedom, their land and it took blood to regain it, 60 years on, we have a terrorist guarantor who never misses a verse to quote.”
A reverse image search reveals that Tuko.co.ke published the picture in this article, although it is cropped only to show the upper part.
The post points to DP’s Facebook page as the source of the image. Ruto’s Facebook timeline review shows that the original image was shared on 1 August 2021. It does not contain a gun.
The same image has been shared by Twitter users here and here, showing the DP kneeling, with no gun in sight.
PesaCheck has looked into the image shared on Facebook claiming to show Kenya’s deputy president, William Ruto, kneeling on a church pew next to a gun, and finds it has been ALTERED.
