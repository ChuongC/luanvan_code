A misleading image
On 14th of March 2021, Eye Radio published a communal violence story where a cattle related attack reportedly left two people killed in Lake State. 
However, the story featured an image with a caption that stated the picture was taken in Yirol County of Lakes State, by the UN Food and Agriculture organization.
It was captioned, “Cattle in Yirol, Lakes State/Credit/FAO”.
But when fact checked by the 211 team, it was identified that the image was taken at Niamana Livestock market, situated in Mali’s Capital, Bamako.  
The research indicated that the picture was taken by Stevie Mann, a commercial photographer who might have supplied the International Livestock Research Institute – an international agricultural research institute based in Nairobi, Kenya.
The image was taken with a Canon EOS-ID Mark II camera. The original picture is seen below. 
Due to critics on Facebook, Eye Radio changed the picture both on its website and Facebook page – a great ethical and professional move.
