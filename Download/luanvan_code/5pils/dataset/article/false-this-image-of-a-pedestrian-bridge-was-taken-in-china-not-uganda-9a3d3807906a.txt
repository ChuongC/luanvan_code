An image shared on Facebook claiming to show a pedestrian bridge at Wandegeya in Kampala, Uganda is FALSE.
The text accompanying the image of the pedestrian bridge reads, “Have you tried crossing the road lately around wandegeya?”
However, a Google reverse image search shows the photo in the claim is a pedestrian bridge in Kunming, China and not Wandegeya in Kampala, Uganda. The image is available in the public domain on Wikimedia where it was uploaded by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) from its Flickr account. ITDP indicates that the photo was taken on 28 November 2009.
The image has been featured here, here and here with a corresponding identification as a pedestrian bridge in Kunming, China.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming to show a pedestrian bridge in Wandegeya, Kampala and finds it to be FALSE.
