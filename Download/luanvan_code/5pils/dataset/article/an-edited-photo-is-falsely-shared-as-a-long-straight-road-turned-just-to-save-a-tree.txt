A photo is being shared widely on social media with a claim that a contractor has turned a long straight road just to save a tree. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: The photo shows a long straight road which is turned just to save a tree.
Fact: It is an edited photo. In the original photo, there is neither a tree in the middle nor the straight road is turned. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found to be viral on the internet for a long time. However, in 2020, a thread debunking the same photo can be found on the ‘Stack Exchange’ website. In the thread, it can be read that the photo has been heavily edited.
The original photo with the same vehicles and similar rocks can be found on the ‘Getty Images’ website. Another photo of the same location with the same vehicles can be seen here.
To sum it up, an edited photo is falsely shared as a long straight road turned just to save a tree.
