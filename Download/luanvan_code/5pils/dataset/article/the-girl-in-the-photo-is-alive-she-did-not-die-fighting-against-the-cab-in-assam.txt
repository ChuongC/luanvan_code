A photo of a woman is being shared widely on Facebook with a claim that she was martyred in the fight against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post 
Claim: Photo of a girl who died fighting against the CAB in Assam.    
Fact: Her name is Dirija Phukon. She is absolutely fine and alive. She has posted on her Facebook account asking people not to spread rumours about her death. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.    
 On one of the similar posts on Facebook, a user ‘Happy Saikia’ has commented that the girl in the photo is her sister and she is absolutely fine. 
‘Happy Saikia’ has also posted the same photo on her Facebook wall with the description: ‘……Dirija is my sister and she is absolutely Fine. Please don’t spread rumours.”
