This tweet with images claiming to be of property damaged by Fano, an ethnic Amhara youth group, in the Oromia region of Ethiopia in December 2022 is FALSE.
The post was shared on 15 December 2022, with a text that reads: “The Oromoo civilian’s property and house’s burning like these by Amhara extremist Fanno groups. The world should know the truth if you don’t want to reveal the truth about these people”
The United Nations, UN Human Rights, Amnesty International, Department of State, and the European Commission, are tagged on the tweet.
Fano is an armed youth movement in the Amhara regional state.
On 7 December 2022, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission issued a report accusing Oromo Liberation Army and Amhara militants of the alleged recent mass killings and attacks in Oromia’s Wollega zone.
However, Google reverse image search results show, as seen here and here, that the images are not of damaged property in the conflict as claimed.
The images were published on this Twitter account on 20 April 2022, a text saying: “We the Oromo people everywhere stand with our brothers and sisters in Wollo in solidarity.”
The second image was used in a report by Ethiopian Monitor on 12 April 2022 in relation to the property damaged by fire in the Afar region.
The second image was similarly featured in a report by Fana Broadcasting Corporate (FBC) on 12 April 2022.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image claiming to show property damaged by Fano in Oromia in December 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
