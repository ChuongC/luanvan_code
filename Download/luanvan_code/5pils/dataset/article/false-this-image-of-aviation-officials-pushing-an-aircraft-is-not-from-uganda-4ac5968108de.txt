A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Ugandan aviation officials pushing an aircraft is FALSE.
The post is captioned in Luganda and reads: “Mukasa, push so hard so that Mutyaba can jumpstart the plane. Uganda Airlines, please do not also exaggerate things.”
A Google reverse image search of the photo in the post shows it was taken in Nigeria, and not Uganda.
The image has been circulating online from as far back as August 2012, as seen here. At that time, Uganda Airlines, the country’s flag carrier, had not yet been revived.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show Uganda aviation officials pushing an aircraft and finds it to be FALSE.
