A post with the image of helicopter crash is doing rounds on social media with a claim that the crash took place in Ladakh. Through this article letâ€™s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of recent MI-17 helicopter crash in Ladakh.
Fact: The image shared in the post is of an MI-17 helicopter crash which happened in Kedarnath back in 2018. This image has nothing to do with Ladakh. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Reverse image search of the photo led us to a few news articles where the same image is featured. According to one such article dated 30 April 2020, the image is of the MI-17 helicopter crash which happened in Kedarnath, Uttarakhand on the same day.  Few more news reports of the same incident can be read here and here. News video reporting of the same incident can be seen here. With this, we can say that the image is old and has nothing to do with Ladakh.
In the wake of the ongoing skirmishes between the Indian and the Chinese armies along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, images like the one in the post are being widely shared across social media platforms with misleading claims.
To sum it up, 2018 image of a helicopter crash in Kedarnath is shared as that of a recent crash in Ladakh.
