Many Facebook users are sharing a post with an image of the bill purportedly issued by Sai Balaji Petroleum in Mumbai. The lower part of the bill receipt has the text “If you want to reduce petrol price don’t vote Modi again. Thank you visit again!”. Let’s try to verify the authenticity of the receipt put in the post.
Claim:  Sai Balaji Petroleum in Mumbai has issued their petrol bill receipts to their customers with the text “If you want to reduce petrol price don’t vote Modi again”.
Fact: The sample bill of a company ‘Goldimine Electrosystems Pvt Ltd’ has been photoshopped and is circulated by a few to gain political mileage in the ongoing General Elections-2019. Hence, the claim is FALSE.    

When the image is searched using Google Reverse Image search in the name of Sai Balaji Petroleum, there were many results. While analyzing each of it, the original bill was found in the sample bill display section present on the left side of ‘Goldimine Electrosystems Pvt Ltd’ company’s website. The bill is edited and the text “If you want to reduce petrol price don’t vote Modi again. Thank you visit again!” is added to it. If one observes the bill in the post, they can clearly see the changes in the font size in it.
Finally, image of the sample bill of a private company has been photoshopped and is being circulated in social media.
