An article, with an image claiming to show Major General Abel Kandiho — the Chief of Military Intelligence in Uganda — smoking, is ALTERED.
The article “Kandiho resorts to smoking as US sanctions give him restless moments” has an image showing Kandiho in civilian attire, smoking. The article attributes its source of information to a “close relative”.
The claim has also been published by the UGNews24 website.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the picture is altered. The original photo is a stock image available for purchase online and has a clear watermark. The photo has been digitally altered to replace the subject’s face and neck with Kandiho’s.
The original image shows striking similarities in the cap, clothing, necklaces and accessories and cigarette positioning with the altered picture.
On 7 December, the US Treasury Department imposed financial sanctions on the Major General over alleged human rights abuses committed under his watch.
PesaCheck has looked into an article with an image claiming to show Major General Abel Kandiho — the Chief of Military Intelligence in Uganda — smoking, and finds it is ALTERED.
