An image shared on Facebook claiming to show armed group Fano marching towards Wollega is FALSE.
“Dessie City Fano approaches the border to enter Wollega and liberate innocent people from the terrorist Shene,” the post in Amharic said. Shene refers to the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA).
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo has no relation to the conflict in Wollega, the Oromia region of Ethiopia.
The original image shows Chinese servicemen during a parade. It was shared on the Getty Images website as seen here. The photo description reads, “Chinese servicemen and military hardware during a parade of military hardware and aviation involved in the main stage of the Vostok 2018 military exercise held jointly by the Russian Armed Forces and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army at the Tsugol range.” The image was taken by Vadim Savitsky/Tass on 13 September 2018.
As seen here and here, the same image was published on the Alamy and The Guardian websites.
The conflict pitting OLA, the Amhara forces, and the Ethiopian Federal troops in Wollega has, according to reports, as seen here and here, displaced hundreds of people.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming to show armed group Fano marching towards Wollega and found it to be FALSE.
