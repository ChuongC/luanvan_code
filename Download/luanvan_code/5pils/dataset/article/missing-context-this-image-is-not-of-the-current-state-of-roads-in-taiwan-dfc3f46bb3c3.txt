A Facebook post claiming to show the current state of roads in Taiwan is MISSING CONTEXT.
“Drivers are not happy in Taiwan,” reads the text accompanying the image.
The post, which was published on 4 June 2023 has an attachment of an image of a highway blocked by debris.
A reverse image search confirms that the highway is in Taiwan. However, our search results show that the incident happened on 25 April 2010 when a landslide destroyed part of Taiwan’s Formosa Freeway (National Freeway №3) and caused deaths. The debris covered 300m of the Keelung-Sijhih section with 200,000m of soil and rock.
Four people and three cars were buried in the landslide. As a result, there was heavy traffic on the Sun Yat-sen Freeway (National Freeway №1). Though it is not clear what caused the landslide, experts predicted that the sharp slope near the highway made it easy for the hillside to collapse.

It was reported that normalcy and regular traffic flow was restored on the highway on 19 June 2010.
Taiwan is one of the most landslide-prone countries in the world due to its steep hillslopes, regular earthquakes and typhoons. At least two destructive landslides attributed to heavy rainfall have been reported in 2023 in Taiwan.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show the current state of roads in Taiwan and found it to be MISSING CONTEXT.
