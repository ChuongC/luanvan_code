An image shared on Facebook claiming to show the war between Russia and Ukraine in 2022 is FALSE.
“Ukraine is becoming a battlefield. The age-old feud between the West and Russia threatens to turn Ukraine into a desert,” parts of the post in Amharic reads. In addition, the post mentions some reports made by different international media outlets like The Guardian and Reuters that are related to the war between Russia and Ukraine.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo is not related to the war between Russia and Ukraine. The image has been available on different online platforms since 2013.
For instance, the image can be seen on this YouTube video, which was uploaded on 7 April 2013, starting from 0:15 minutes. Also, the image was shared on the Defence World website on 13 October 2017. The caption reads, “US Anti-Ballistic Missiles To Exceed 1000 By 2020, Surpassing Russia: Russian Ministry”.
The same image can be found on other websites as seen here and here.
Although there is an ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the image under investigation is not related to this.
