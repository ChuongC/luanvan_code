This Facebook post with photos it claims were taken at Kasarani convention of Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party leader, Raila Odinga on 10 December 2021, is FALSE.
“Mmeona hiyo video ya Kasarani Stadium Leo… aki nmehurumia huyo mama alikuwa na mtoto oneni video hapa
vile watu walienda Kasarani wamefanyiwa or comment na namba yako nikurushie WhatsApp.
[Have you seen the video of Kasarani Stadium today … I feel sorry for the mother who had a child watch the video here 👇 see what happened to people who went to Kasarani or comment your number and let me share with you on WhatsApp], the Facebook post reads.
A link to a Telegram group “Official Kilimani Mums” is also attached to the post.
On 10 December 2021, the ODM leader held an event at the Kasarani Stadium dubbed “Azimio La Umoja Convention”. The former prime minister used it to announce his 2022 presidential bid and outlined what he would offer Kenyans once he becomes president.
Thousands of supporters thronged the 60,000-capacity stadium. Nation Africa shared a video showing chaos at the VIP entrance of the stadium where the Azimio La Umoja event took place.
To verify if indeed the photos were taken at Odinga’s convention, we performed a reverse image search and discovered that these are old photos.
Results for the first image show it was taken in April 2015 after the Al Shabaab attack at Garissa University College in Kenya. The caption of the photo, which was taken by Herman Kariuki of Reuters reads, “A relative of a victim killed in the Garissa University College attack is helped by Red Cross staff”.
A reverse image search reveals the second image was taken on 28 November 2017 during President Uhuru Kenyatta’s inauguration at Kasarani Stadium.
The caption of the image which was taken by Baz Ratner reads, “People fall as police fire tear gas to try to control a crowd trying to force their way into a stadium to attend the inauguration of President Uhuru Kenyatta at Kasarani Stadium in Nairobi, Kenya”.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show images taken at the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party leader, Raila Odinga’s Azimio La Umoja Convention at Kasarani Stadium on 10 December 2021, and finds it to be FALSE.
