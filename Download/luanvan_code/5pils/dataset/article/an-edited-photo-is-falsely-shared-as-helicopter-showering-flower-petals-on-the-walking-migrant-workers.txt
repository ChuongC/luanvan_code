A photo is being widely shared on social media with a claim that it shows a helicopter showering flower petals on the migrant workers walking back to their hometowns. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of helicopter showering flower petals on the walking migrant workers.
Fact: The photo is an edited one. Two different photos are clubbed to show that petals are being showered on the walking migrant workers. While the helicopter photo was taken in 2018, the migrant workers walking photo was taken in March 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. 
On observing the photo, the differences in the sky can be clearly seen. When the helicopter part was cropped and ran through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, it was found in ‘The Seattle Times’ article published in 2018. In the description, it can be read that the photo was taken during the Republic Day parade in 2018. The same photo can be also found on the ‘AP Images’ website.
On cropping the migrants part and running it through Google Reverse Image Search, the photo was found in ‘The Statesman’ article published in March 2020. In the description, it can be read that the photo was taken in Faridabad on 27 March 2020. The photo can be also found on the ‘Getty Images’ website. The armed forces showered flower petals on 03 May 2020 to salute corona warriors, the frontline health workers.
To sum it up, an edited photo is falsely shared as ‘Helicopter showering flower petals on the walking migrant workers’.
