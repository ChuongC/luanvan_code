An image shared on Twitter claiming to show Metro shuttle matatus in London is SATIRICAL.
The image shows two buses, with the branding of Nairobi-based minibuses belonging to the Super Metro SACCO, making their entrance into Buckingham Palace.
“African Presidents in METRO SHUTTLE matatus as spotted in London in honour of the Royal British Monarch,” the tweet reads.
The image was shared after news reports including by Nation Africa indicated that African presidents were ferried to Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral in coaches provided by the United Kingdom government.
However, a reverse image search indicates that the picture has been doctored to include the Super Metro minibuses. Among the search results is an article by Newsweek.com containing the image.
The image is attributed to the BBC and the caption states that the picture is of world leaders arriving in buses for the queen’s funeral. However, the buses pictured therein do not contain the branding of Super Metro minibuses as claimed.
PesaCheck has examined the image post claiming to show Metro shuttle matatus in London, and finds it to be SATIRICAL.
