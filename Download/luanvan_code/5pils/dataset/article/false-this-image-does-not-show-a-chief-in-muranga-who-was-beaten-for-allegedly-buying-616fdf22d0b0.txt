A Facebook post with an image allegedly showing a chief in Murang’a, Kenya, who was beaten for buying identification cards is FALSE.
The claim was also shared here and here.
“Usicheze na raia!!! (Don’t play with the citizens) Anyway quick recovery Chief.[][][] A chief in Muranga County beaten mercilessly while allegedly buying ID cards. Quick Recovery,” the post reads.
In the run-up to the Kenyan 9 August polls, there were allegations of some people buying national identity cards from prospective voters, bribery attempts on party polling agents and an alleged scheme to deploy chiefs to influence the outcome of the election. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) said the matter had been reported to the police.
A Google reverse search of the image in the claim, however, shows that it is old and unrelated to Kenya. The photo was featured by Tumfweko, a Zambian news and entertainment website, on 19 November 2014.
“Photo: Drunk Police Officer Pees in Uniform,” the headline reads.
The man in the image is also not wearing a uniform consistent with the Kenyan chiefs’ uniform and there are no reports from credible sources on such an incident in Murang’a.
Pesacheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly showing a chief in Murang’a, who was beaten for allegedly buying ID cards, and finds it to be FALSE.
