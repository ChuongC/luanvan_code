2014 image falsely shared as PM Modi’s visit to hospital on the birth of Ambani’s grandson - FACTLY

A post accompanying an image of Narendra Modi along with Mukesh Ambani and his wife in a hospital is being widely shared across social media platforms with a claim that the PM visited Ambani’s newborn grandson at the hospital. Through this article let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: PM Modi visited Ambani’s grandson at the hospital.
Fact: The image was actually clicked during the inauguration of HN Reliance Hospital and Research Centre in Mumbai back in 2014. The image has nothing to do with the birth of Ambani’s grandson. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Google search with relevant keywords led us to a 2014 news article which carried a flipped image of the image in the post. According to this article, the image was clicked back in 2014 when Modi inaugurated the HN Reliance Hospital and Research Centre in Mumbai.
Another news article shared the same flipped image mentioning it to be related to the Reliance Hospital inauguration by Modi. Further, PMO India’s official YouTube channel uploaded the video of the event which can be seen here. Also, we could not find any news articles saying that the PM visited Ambani’s grandchild at the hospital.
In the light of the ongoing protest by farmers against the new farm bills, posts like these are being widely circulated across social media platforms with misleading claims.
To sum it up, the image was actually clicked during Reliance hospital inauguration back in 2014.
