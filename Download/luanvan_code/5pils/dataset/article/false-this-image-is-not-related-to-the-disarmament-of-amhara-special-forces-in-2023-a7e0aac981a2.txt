This tweet purporting to share an image of Amhara Special Forces disarmed by the Ethiopian government in 2023 is FALSE.
The Amharic text accompanying the image translates to; “Following the campaign of disarming the regional special forces, the Abiy government took an action of disarming the members of the Amhara Special Forces Brigade, who were maintaining peace and guarding the border in Welkait Tegede area.”
There are media reports that the Ethiopian government intends to integrate all regional special forces into either the national army, the federal or regional police.
The intention to dissolve regional forces has sparked demonstrations in the Amhara region.
The photo is, however, unrelated to the disarming of the Amhara Special Forces, according to Google reverse image search results.
The photo was published on the Tigrai24 News Facebook account on 14 November 2020 alongside the text: “Here are some of the enemy armies that have surrendered. Facing the Tigray army is summoning death by your own will.”
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet claiming to share an image of Amhara Special Forces disarmed by the Ethiopian government in 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
