An image shared on Facebook claiming to show military vehicles destroyed in Wollega in June 2022 is FALSE.
“Today’s performance,” claims the post in Afaan Oromo shared on 25 June 2022. It is accompanied by an emoji of a flexing arm.
“The foolish can’t move in Wollega as they wish,” the post says, adding, “rip Empire”.
Oromia regional state announced a military operation called “coordinated campaign against Shene” on 22 June 2022, following the killings in west Wollega.
However the image we are investigating doesn’t show the incident occurred in Wollega in June 2022 as claimed.
Results of reverse image search on Google reveals that the photo has been available online since July 2021, attributed to the war in the Tigray region.
A video with the image was first shared on Reddit on 9 July 2021, with the caption “ENDF (ethiopian army) convoy gets ambushed as it withdraws from Tigray”.
The Ethiopian government withdrew its army from the Tigrayan capital in late June 2021, but Tigrayan forces relaunched an offensive a month later.
In June 2022, however, the Ethiopian government established a committee to negotiate with Tigray forces as a step towards restoring peace in the region.
PesaCheck has investigated an image shared on Facebook claiming to show military vehicles destroyed in Wollega in June 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
