A Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) force being “heavily attacked” at Lalibela by the Ethiopian Air Force is FALSE.
An image of a fighter jet is attached to the post whose text in Amharic translates, “TPLF force heavily attacked in an unexpected place and time by our Air Forces at Lalibela”.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the Yqqlm website published the image on 11 November 2020, along with an article about Azerbaijan shooting down a Russian MI-24 helicopter. The Azerbaijan president later apologised for the incident.
Lalibela is a holy site for millions of Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. It is located in the North of the Wollo Zone of the Amhara region in Ethiopia. This region has, since 5 August 2021, been under TPLF’s control.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the TPLF force being heavily attacked unexpectedly at Lalibela by the Ethiopian Air Force and finds it to be FALSE.
