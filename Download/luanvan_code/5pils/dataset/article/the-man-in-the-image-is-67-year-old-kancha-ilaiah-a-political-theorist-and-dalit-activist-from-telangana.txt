A post with a photo is being widely shared on Facebook with a claim that the person in the photo is 47-year-old Moinuddin from Kerala, and he has been studying in JNU since 1989. Let’s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.

Fact: The man in the photo is Kancha Ilaiah, a Political theorist and Dalit activist. He is 67 years old and belongs to Telangana state. So, the claim is FALSE.
