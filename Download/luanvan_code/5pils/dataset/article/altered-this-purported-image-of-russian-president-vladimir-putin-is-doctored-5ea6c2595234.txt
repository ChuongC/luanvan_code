An image shared on Facebook purporting to show Russian President Vladimir Putin is ALTERED.
The post in Amharic translates to, “The expansionist country, Russia, President Vladimir Putin said that he is ready for negotiation, according to the international media reports. America’s sanction is yielding results.”
An image showing a man in a suit standing with a group of people in military uniforms is attached to the post. The post identifies this man as President Putin.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image is doctored. In the claimed image, Putin’s face is replaced with Agegnehu Teshager, the Speaker House of the Federation of Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.
The original image, shared on the Alamay website, indeed shows Putin. Its description says, “Russian President Vladimir Putin stands with members of the Vympel military and patriotic centre following a ceremony in Red Square November 4, 2015, in Moscow, Russia.” Image credit is given to Kremlin Pool and the image was taken on 20 November 2015.
The claim was shared as Russia continues its military invasion of Ukraine.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook purporting to show Russian President Vladimir Putin and found it to be ALTERED.
