A Facebook post with images portraying prison conditions and arrests by security officers in Uganda is PARTLY FALSE.
The post, which calls on international organisations to ‘stand with Uganda’, advocates for the freeing of all prisoners in the nation and for President Yoweri Museveni to step down.
However, not all the photos are from Uganda. A Google reverse image search of Image 1 indicates that it is from Nigeria, and is associated with articles about an incident when citizens took the law into their own hands and punished suspected thieves.
Image 2 and image 3 were taken in Uganda, posted by human rights lawyer Eron Kiiza, decrying the state of the country’s prisons.
Image 4 has also been widely shared by Ugandan media outlets according to an online search.
PesaCheck has looked into a claim that these images were all taken in Uganda showing prison conditions and brutal arrests and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
