This Facebook post with images claiming to show the conflict in northern Ethiopia is FALSE.
The pictures are accompanied by a text in Amharic that translates as; “Breaking news. Today at 12:00 p.m., the joint army liberated four cities. The truth is revealed!! The victory of the ‘Joint army’. The hope of Getachew Reda was lost. Where did 200,000 young people from Tigray go in three weeks? Information leaked from a secret Telegram group of TPLF supporters living abroad!!!! You can see it by clicking the following Telegram link !”
Four images are attached to the post, supporting a claim that they show renewed conflict in August 2022 after a five-month truce.
However, as seen here, here, here, and here, Google lens reverse image search results disclosed that the photos are old and unrelated to the conflict in Ethiopia.
The first image was shared on this website on 6 September 2021, in an article headlined: “How Capable Are Pakistan’s New VT-4 Battle Tanks? Why New Chinese-Supplied Armour Could Be a Game Changer”
The same image was also used here and here.
The second picture was published on the Bangkok Post website on 9 May 2017 with a caption stating: “Tanks crews from the 2nd Cavalry Division, Royal Guards, held their annual training exercise Monday at Baan Deelang, Lop Buri’s Phatthana Nikhom district. The army says its US M41 tanks are outdated and replacing them with Chinese models.” Photo credit is given to WassanaNanuam.
As seen here and here, the same picture is used on other websites.
The third photo was posted on this website on 24 February 2014. A section of the caption reads: “Royal Thai M60A1 battle tanks fire their main guns during a combined arms live-fire exercise as part of exercise Cobra Gold in Training Centre Ban Chan Krem, Kingdom of Thailand, Feb. 21.”
As seen here, the fourth picture was shared on the Asia Pacific Defense Journal website on 9 January 2019, with the caption: “One of Thailand’s VT4 main battle tanks delivered in 2017.” The photo credit is c/o Shephard Media.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with images claiming to show the conflict in northern Ethiopia and finds it to be FALSE.
