A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack by the Ethiopian Air Force on a logistics store owned by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates, “Breaking: The Air Force has been attacking successfully targeted selected logistic store locations of the TPLF with drones.”
On 26 August 2022, there were news reports that a kindergarten in the Tigray capital, Mekelle, was hit by an air strike, leaving at least seven people dead.
However, despite the prevailing tension, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo is unrelated to the Ethiopian conflict.
The Defense Post website published the picture on 1 October 2020, with a description that reads, “An MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle flying a combat mission over southern Afghanistan in 2008.” The image is credited to Lt. Col. Leslie Pratt/US Air Force.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone attack by the Ethiopian Air Force on a logistics store belonging to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and finds it to be FALSE.
