Three images shared on Facebook claiming to show a truck razed by a mob of boda boda riders on January 22, 2021, in Kenya is FALSE.
The images are accompanied by a post that partly reads: “another hustler VS dynasty boda boda guys along Namanga have this evening put to act what’s (sic) there (sic) master have been preaching for them…”
The “hustler versus dynasty” narrative — alluded to in political discussions in Kenya — pits Deputy President William Ruto, who refers to himself as a ‘hustler’ who has risen through the ranks, against politicians whose wealth and family backgrounds have long dominated the country’s political scene.
But was this truck set ablaze by boda boda riders in Namanga town, on the border between Kenya and Tanzania, on January 22 as the post claims? We checked.
A reverse image search on Google reveals the photos were taken after an accident that occurred in Eldoret in July 2020.
It appears that the image is captured from a video of the incident that was shared on YouTube in July last year and not from an incident in January as claimed in the post.
PesaCheck has looked into the authenticity of three images shared on Facebook claiming to show a truck razed by a mob of boda boda riders in Namanga, Kenya, on January 22, 2021, and finds that it is FALSE.
