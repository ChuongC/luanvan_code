A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a US military aircraft that crashed during a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercise in Norway, is FALSE.
The post reads, “NATO military aircraft have reportedly crashed in northern Norway — local media citing rescue services. An American NATO military aircraft with a crew of four onboard has crashed in Norway…”
On 18 March 2022, a US military aircraft crashed in Norway killing four American service members. The crew were taking part in a NATO exercise when the aircraft crashed in a remote region of Norway.
NATO has been conducting drills in Norway which bring together thousands of soldiers from its allies and partners. The training is aimed at testing troops’ readiness for combat in cold conditions, in a training known as Cold Response 2022.
However, Google’s reverse image search results show that the picture in the claim is not related to the US aircraft crash in Norway in March 2022.
On 13 October 2018, the Marine Times news website published the image in an article about US Navy F-35s that resumed flying after grounding. The aircraft were cleared to fly after the military ordered their grounding to enable an inspection of the fuel tubes in the engines.
The image was posted on other websites as seen here, here, and here, before the accident involving the US military plane that crashed in northern Norway.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a US military aircraft that crashed during a NATO exercise in Norway in 2022, and finds it to be FALSE.
