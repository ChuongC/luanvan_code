A Facebook post with a photo allegedly of Otonglo in Kisumu County, Kenya, is FALSE.
“This is Otonglo in Kisumu, but the local media will never show you this,” the text accompanying the photo reads.
The photo has also been shared here and here, claiming to be of Eldoret and Egoji towns respectively.
The image features a lengthy road surrounded by high-rise buildings with cars parked along the way.
But is this a photo of a town in Kenya?
We performed a reverse image search and established that the photo is of Union Street in San Francisco, California, in the United States of America.
Information in the photo description section indicates that it was taken by photographer Michael Weber on 25 August 2011.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared on Facebook allegedly of Otonglo in Kisumu County, Kenya, and finds it to be FALSE.
