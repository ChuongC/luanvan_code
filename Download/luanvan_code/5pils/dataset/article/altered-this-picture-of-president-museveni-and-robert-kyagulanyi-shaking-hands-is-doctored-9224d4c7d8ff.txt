A picture posted on Twitter in which Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni shakes hands with opposition politician Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, is ALTERED.
Posted by government spokesperson Ofwono Opondo, the picture’s accompanying text reads; “Oba when was this. Tongues are wagging”.
Opondo tags Joel Ssenyonyi, the spokesperson for the National Unity Platform (NUP) political party, of which Kyagulanyi is president.
Opondo posted the picture amid discussions in the mainstream and social media about a cooperation agreement that Museveni signed with the opposition Democratic Party president, Norbert Mao. The agreement saw Mao appointed Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs.
Responding to Opondo’s post, tweeps shared an original picture that was altered. The original photo shows retired Uganda Peoples Defence Forces officer Henry Tumukunde shaking hands with Kyagulanyi.
Another tweep also shared it.
A Google reverse image search shows this picture was first used in 2017, by the Uganda Radio Network in an article titled; In Pictures: Three Days of the Age Limit Debate in Parliament. It was used again in 2020.
PesaCheck has looked into a picture posted on Twitter in which Uganda President Yoweri Museveni shakes hands with opposition politician Robert Kyagulanyi and finds it to be ALTERED.
