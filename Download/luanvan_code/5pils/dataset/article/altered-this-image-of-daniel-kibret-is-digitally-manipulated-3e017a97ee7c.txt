A Facebook image claiming to show Daniel Kibret, a social affairs advisor to the Ethiopian prime minister, is ALTERED.
Parts of the post in Amharic reads: “Yesterday and today, instead of sending messages that will give hope, Daniel Kibret is sending messages that will frustrate his fans. His messages are related to escape. Yesterday, by relating it to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, he said, ‘we are on Friday. There are people like Judah who will sell others, people like Peter who will deny, and there are those like all the other disciples who will run away thinking that everything is over.’ And he states that there are some people from the Prosperity Party who will sell Abiy, who will say that they are not with him and those who will run away. Daniel may tell us who these people are on Sunday”.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image used to support the claim is digitally altered and has been compiled from two separate images. One of the original images is sourced from Getty Images.
The same image has previously been published on different online platforms. For instance, it was used on the Light and Vasarnap websites on 13 December 2018 and 27 November 2020, respectively, as seen here and here.
The above image shows the undoctored photo of Daniel Kibret that was used in the compilation.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show Daniel Kibret, who is the social affairs advisor to the Ethiopian prime minister, and finds it to be ALTERED.
