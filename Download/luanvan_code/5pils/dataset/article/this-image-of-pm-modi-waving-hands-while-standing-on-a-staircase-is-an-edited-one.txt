An image capturing PM Modi standing on the staircase of an under-construction building and waving hands is being widely shared on social media. Let’s verify the authenticity of the image shared in the post.
Claim: Image of PM Modi standing on the staircase of an under-construction building and waving hands.
Fact: This is an edited image. The real image shows PM Modi bowing and waving hands at a public meeting in Karnataka’s Tumukur in May 2023. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Conducting a reverse image search on the viral image revealed several images of PM Modi, among which we discovered a matching instance during his recent Karnataka election campaign in Tumkur in May 2023. In that event, Modi was seen wearing the saffron-coloured jacket depicted in the viral picture.
Taking a cue from this, we proceeded to search for videos of various events attended by Modi in Tumkur. Our search yielded a particular footage (here & here) wherein he can be observed entering the dais and expressing his respect to the public through a waving gesture.
Upon comparison of these visuals with the viral image, it becomes apparent that the image from this event was edited to give the impression of PM Modi standing on the staircase of an under-construction building.
To sum it up, an edited image of PM Modi, wherein he is seen waving his hands while standing on the staircase of an under-construction building, is being circulated as an authentic image.
