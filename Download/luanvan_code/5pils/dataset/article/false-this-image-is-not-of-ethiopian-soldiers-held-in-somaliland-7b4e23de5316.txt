A tweet with an image purportedly of Ethiopian soldiers captured in Somaliland is FALSE.
“Mustafe Cagjar is behind the conflict in Laascaanood. Here are some of his captured soldiers,” the tweet reads. Laascaanood is in Somaliland.
Mustafe Cagjar refers to the Somali region president Mustafe Omer. The tweet tags the Ethiopian Prime Minister (PM) Abiy Ahmed.
Google search results for the word “Mustafe Cagjar” shows that it is a name associated with Mustafe Omer.
The tweet was also shared by another user with the text: “@AbiyAhmedAli we all watched @M_cagjar as he hosted these terrorists in Jigjiga in a bid to destabilize Somaliland. Why is Ethiopia invading our country! These men are Ethiopian citizens-Cagjar’s tribal tropes & fascist expansionist ambitions will not be condoned in Somaliland!”
In this tweet, Abiy and a Twitter account that claims to be the Somali region president’s Twitter handle are tagged. However, this is the verified Twitter account of Mustafe Omer, the Somali region’s president.
But Google reverse image search results show the claim image is old and is not of Ethiopian soldiers.
President Mustafe shared the photo on verified Twitter account on 5 August 2022. It is of members of Al Shabaab arrested in Ethiopia in 2022.
In July 2022, Ethiopian forces exchanged fire with Al Shabaab on the Ethiopia-Somalia border. The BBC reported that Al Shabaab had crossed into Ethiopia.
PesaCheck has examined the tweet with an image purportedly of Ethiopian soldiers captured in Somaliland and found it to be FALSE.
