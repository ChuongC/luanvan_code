A Facebook post with an image claiming to be of the Ethiopian Air Force spreading a warning message in Mekelle city is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by text in Afaan Oromo that translates as; “The heroic Ethiopian Air Force was broadcasting a short text message by air yesterday in Mekelle city. It is a reminder that peaceful people should stay away from TPLF weapon depots and settlements where TPLF leaders concealed.”
Mekelle is the capital of the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia.
On 26 August 2022, the federal government issued a notice warning Tigray residents to stay away from areas where the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) training facilities are located. News reports indicate that the Ethiopian army captured the towns of Shire, Alamata, and Korem in Tigray on 18 October 2022.
However, the attached image is not of the Ethiopian Air Force distributing warning leaflets in Mekelle, as claimed.
Google reverse image search results established that the image is of US soldiers dropping leaflets over a village near Hawijah in Kirkuk province, Iraq, in March 2008.
The image was captured by the United States Department of Defense on 14 March 2008. The leaflets were to promote the idea of self-government to area residents.
PesaCheck has investigated a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of the Ethiopian Air Force dropping warning leaflets in Mekelle city and finds it to be FALSE.
