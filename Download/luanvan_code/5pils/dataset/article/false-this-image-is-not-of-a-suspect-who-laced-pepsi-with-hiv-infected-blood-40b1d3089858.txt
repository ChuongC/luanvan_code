This video posted on Facebook purportedly of a person who laced a Pepsi drink with his Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected blood, is FALSE.
The footage shows a person being escorted by individuals whose attire is inscribed with the word “Interpol”.
The write-up below the picture reads: “This is the guy who added his infected blood to Pepsi”.
The text continues: “For the next few weeks do not drink any products from Pepsi, as a worker from the company has added his blood contaminated with HIV(AIDS). It was shown yesterday on Sky News. Please forward this message to the people who you care”.
The video with similar allegations is posted on Tiktok.
PesaCheck conducted a reverse image search using Yandex to verify the claim and found that the photo has been online since 2014.
Contrary to the claim, we established that the image shows a suspect in a 2014 bombing in Nigeria.
Through a keyword search, we further established that the person in the picture is Aminu Ogwuche, a suspected bomb attack mastermind who had been arrested in Sudan and handed over to the Nigerian authorities by Interpol.
This story was published by other media houses both in Nigeria and Sudan in 2014.
In addition, we did a keyword search to check if Sky News, which the author purports to be the source, indeed published the story.
There was no such a story but we found earlier fact-checks debunking this claim as false.
PesaCheck looked into a video posted on Facebook claiming to show a man said to have added his HIV-infected blood to Pepsi soda and found it to be FALSE.
