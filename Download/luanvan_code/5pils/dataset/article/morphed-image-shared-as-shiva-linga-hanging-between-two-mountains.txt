A post with an image of a Shiva Linga sculpture situated between two mountains is being widely shared on social media with the claim that the sculpture is in India. Through this article let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: An image of a Shiva Linga sculpture situated between two mountains in India.
Fact: Image of a hanging rock in Norway is photoshopped so as to look like a Shiva lingam hanging between two mountains. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Reverse image search of the photo in the post led us to a listicle which carried a similar image. The title of the listicle reads “15 reasons why Norway will rock your world”. The listicle identifies the image as ‘Majestic Hanging Stone, Kjerag’ in Norway.
Taking a cue from the listicle, search on Google Maps with the relevant keywords led us to Kjeragbolton in Norway where the small rock can be seen hanging between two mountains similar to the image seen in the post. Video of the mountain can be seen here. With this, we can say that the image of hanging rock is digitally morphed so as to look like a Shiva Lingam  hanging between two mountains.
To sum it up, the image of a hanging rock in Norway is photoshopped so as to look like a Shiva lingam hanging between two mountains.
