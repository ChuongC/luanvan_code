A post questioning the fairness in the investigation of Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide case is doing rounds on social media. The post shares a photo claiming it to be of Sushant Singh’s alleged girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty with Maharastra CM Uddhav Thackeray’s son Aditya Thackeray who is also a minister in Maharastra. Through this article let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Sushant Singh Rajput’s alleged girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty with Shiv Sena leader & Maharashtra Minister Aditya Thackeray.
Fact: The women in the image along with Aditya Thackeray is not Rhea Chakraborty, she is actress Disha Patani. The image was clicked when the duo went for an outing back in June 2019 and several news portals reported the same. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When we ran a reverse image search of the photo in the post, we found several news articles reporting the image. According to these news articles, the woman in the image along with Aditya Thackeray is Disha Patani, a Bollywood actress and the picture was clicked when the duo went on an outing back in June 2019. The news articles reporting this can be read here and here.
When we compare images of both Disha Patani and Rhea Chakraborty with that of the women in the car with Aditya Thackeray, we can conclude that the woman in the car is indeed Disha Patani.
The above post is being shared in the context of an FIR filed by Sushant Singh Rajput’s father K.K. Singh against Rhea Chakraborty for abetment of suicide.
To sum it up, the woman in the image with Aditya Thackeray is not Rhea Chakraborty.
