A Facebook post claiming that the military has surrounded the Magere house of politician Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, in Kampala, Uganda is FALSE.
Bobi Wine, who came second in the 2021 Uganda elections after losing to incumbent Yoweri Museveni, has expressed fears over his safety and that of his family.
The singer-turned-politician sent his children out of the country as a security measure following kidnap threats.
Bobi Wine further made headlines when he purchased a ‘bullet proof’ car in February, which has raised criticism from state and non-state actors.
The claim also states “they need our bullet proof”, suggesting that security personnel intend to seize Mr Kyagulanyi’s newly acquired armoured vehicle which has featured prominently in recent news reports.
However a Google reverse search of the image reveals that it was taken in January 2021 when security forces surrounded Bobi Wine’s home while he was under house arrest.
The government says his arrest was a preventative measure aimed at neutralising security threats and the possibility of violence after he lost the presidential election.
PesaCheck has looked into an image with a claim that it was taken at Bobi Wine’s home in Magere as security forces tried to take away the legislator’s newly purchased ‘bullet proof car’ and finds it to be FALSE.
