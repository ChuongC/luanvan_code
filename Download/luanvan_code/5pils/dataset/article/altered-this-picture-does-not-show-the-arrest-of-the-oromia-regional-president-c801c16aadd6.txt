A Facebook post claiming that the Oromia regional President Shimelis Abdisa was arrested is ALTERED.
The image shows a man with the face of Shimelis handcuffed and being led by the Ethiopian Defense Force soldiers. This video titled “Today’s Breaking news: Shimelis Abdisa was arrested” purporting to announce the arrest was shared on 6 November 2021 on Facebook.
On 26 September 2021, the Oromia regional council reelected Shimelis as President of Oromia National Regional State.
On 6 November 2021, Shimelis was interviewed by the Local Media OBN TV. He explains how the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) led Ethiopia for 27 years. Shimelis also talks about the alliance of TPLF and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLF).
However, the Google reverse image search shows that the photo showing Shimelis’ arrest has been altered. The original image is of a man described in this article as the “mastermind” behind TPLF’s military strategy, Sebhat Nega, who was arrested by Ethiopian security officers on 8 January 2021.
Similarly, no news media reported Shimelis arrest. The content of the video is not related to the claimed arrest.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming to show the arrest of Oromia regional President Shimelis Abdisa and found it to be ALTERED.
