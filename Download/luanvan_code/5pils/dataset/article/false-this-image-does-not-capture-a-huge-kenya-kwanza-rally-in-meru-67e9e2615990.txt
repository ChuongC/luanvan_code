A tweet sharing an image allegedly showing a huge crowd during a Kenya Kwanza rally in Meru on 13 July 2022, is FALSE.
The image shows a massive crowd gathered around two vehicles, one of which has subjects seemingly addressing the crowd from the sunroof.
Accompanying the post is a caption reading; “This place is called Meru. Rigathi the next DP is rocking.”
A reverse image search reveals that the picture was from a Kenya Kwanza rally in Karatina, Nyeri County, and not Meru as alleged.
The image was first shared by Deputy President William Ruto on 21 May 2022. It was also shared by the DP’s digital strategist, Dennis Itumbi, and by The Star on the same date.
On Wednesday, 13 June 2022, a section of Kenya Kwanza leaders, including Ruto’s running mate, Rigathi Gachagua, had a rally in Igembe North, Meru County. However, the rally ended prematurely after rival groups reportedly clashed.
A report by The Standard indicates that Gachagua was whisked to safety after the rowdy groups started pelting stones at the rally venue. Police were forced to hurl tear gas to restore calm. Gachagua had earlier addressed gatherings in other parts of the county.
PesaCheck has looked into the tweet with an image claiming to show a huge political rally by the Kenya Kwanza coalition in Meru County and found it to be FALSE.
