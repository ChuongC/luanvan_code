A tweet with an image of the Daily Nation newspaper’s cover page and a headline quoting Deputy President William Ruto as saying “Jubilee is an abusive marriage”, is ALTERED.
The altered page, dated October 19, 2020, also carries a subhead claiming that the DP has deemed his political union with President Uhuru Kenyatta at the Jubilee Party irredeemable.
The DP, who is campaigning to succeed President Kenyatta — whose second and last term ends in August 2022 — has of late been traversing the country in a bid to popularise his candidature.
However, the legitimate front page image, which has been shared on the Nation Media Group’s website and the Daily Nation’s verified Facebook accounts, shows that the lead story and photo have been altered. The other stories highlighted are similar to those carried cover of the genuine publication.
The lead story on the genuine publication carried a story about debts accumulating for people who borrowed loans from banks and other financial institutions during the “relief from Covid-19 period”, and is accompanied by a photo of young learners in a classroom.
PesaCheck has looked into an image of a front-page alleged to be that of The Daily Nation newspaper of October 19 with the title claiming that DP Ruto has said his union with President Kenyatta and the Jubilee Party is an abusive marriage, and finds it has been ALTERED.
