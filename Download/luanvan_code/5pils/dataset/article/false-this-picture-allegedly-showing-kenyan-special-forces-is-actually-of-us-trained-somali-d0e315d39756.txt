A Facebook post with a photo claiming to show members of Kenya’s elite security forces who neutralized the attack on 14 Riverside and the DusitD2 Hotel in Nairobi is FALSE.
The post points out that the teams carrying out the rescue operation were composed entirely of men, but nobody seemed to complain, an allusion to conversations in Kenya over the constitutional requirement for gender parity in appointments to public office known as the ‘Two-Thirds Gender Rule’. The rule stipulates that appointments to public positions should not exceed two-thirds of one gender, in an attempt to ensure gender parity.

However, while the original poster claimed to have watched KENYA’S ELITE SQUAD & RECCE SQUAD’ in an allusion to the images in the post, a reverse image search of the first photo in the post reveals that it is a picture of US trained Somali Commandos who are involved in fighting terrorism in Somalia. It first appeared in a March 2014 story on the Somali language news site raadreeb.com that has since been taken down.
The photo was also featured in a YouTube video published in 2016 with images of Somali police officers. According to the website, these elite group of Somali Special Forces is also known as the Alpha Group or dhanab, which means lightning in the local Somali language.
A reverse image search of the second picture used in the same post revealed that the photo was actually of Kenyan security special forces taken by a Standard Group photographer at the Dusit D2 Complex.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the two shared photos are those of Kenya’s elite security forces who neutralized the recent terror attack at the DusitD2 Hotel in Nairobi and finds one of them to be false thus making the to contain a MIXTURE of both true and false images.
