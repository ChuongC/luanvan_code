A Facebook post with images said to be of an airstrike in selected areas of Ethiopia’s Olonkomi and Mendi towns is FALSE.
Two images are accompanied by an Afaan Oromo text that translates to; “A second airstrike was carried out in the area of ​​Olonkomi stadium and West Wollega Mendi town.”
Addis Standard reported that an airstrike by federal forces killed civilians in Mendi town, west college zone of Oromia region on 9 November 2022. The town has been reportedly under the control of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) since the week before.
However, Google Lens reverse image search results here and here show that the pictures were published online before the conflict in West Wollega, Oromia, in November 2022.
The first image was published together with other photos on 20 November 2020 in a BBC article titled, “Ethiopia’s Tigray crisis: Fact-Checking misleading images”.
The photographer, in addition, shared the image on his Facebook account on 18 January 2020. The picture is of a Sukhoi Su-25 of the Uzbekistan Air Force.
The second image was published on the Itamilradar website on 12 April 2022, in an article titled, “New surveillance mission by Turkish drone”.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with images said to be of an airstrike in selected areas of Olonkomi and Mendi towns, Ethiopia, and finds it to be FALSE.
