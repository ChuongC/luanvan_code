A Facebook post claiming to show cattle ravaged by hunger in the Guji zone of Ethiopia is FALSE.
The text posted with the image, written in Afaan Oromo, translates: “The cows are dying and suffering from hunger in Guji town.”
Guji is a zone in the Oromia region of Ethiopia.
Media have reported drought in the southern part of Oromia, especially in Borana and Guji zones. A report by VOA Amharic, for instance, shared on its official Facebook page shows more than 4,000 cattle have died in the Borana zone of Oromia region due to a failure of the bi-annual rains.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo in the claim is not related to events in the Guji Zone of Ethiopia.
The image was posted on the Baitulmaal website on 20 December 2021. The photo features in an article describing the impact of drought in Kenya.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show cattle ravaged by hunger in the Guji zone of Ethiopia and finds it to be FALSE.
