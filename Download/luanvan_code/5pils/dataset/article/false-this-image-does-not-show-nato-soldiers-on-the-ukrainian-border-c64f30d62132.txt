An image posted on Facebook claiming to show 40,000 soldiers under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) marching to the Ukrainian border is FALSE.
“Breaking News: NATO marched 40,000 soldiers to western Europe on the border of Ukraine. Among the 40,000 soldiers, 8 thousand are Americans. 100 military air and 120 ships of war included in the marches. Reports talk as NATO agreed to take final action,” the post in Afaan Oromoo reads.
Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. As a result, on 25 February 2022, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance was deploying thousands of combat-ready troops to Ukraine’s neighbours and sending weapons to Ukraine to confront Russian aggression.
The United States, European Union, and other Western allies announced different sanctions against Russians and businesses.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo we are fact-checking is old and unrelated to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The image was published on 8 April 2016 on the University of Southern California news website. The article talks about NATO’S Public Diplomacy in the Grey zone of Conflict.
The image was also posted on the Texas National Security Review website on 9 June 2015 in an article describing “The MYTH of Entangling Alliances.” Another website published the image, as seen here and here.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show 40,000 NATO soldiers marching to western Europe on the Ukrainian border and finds it to be FALSE.
