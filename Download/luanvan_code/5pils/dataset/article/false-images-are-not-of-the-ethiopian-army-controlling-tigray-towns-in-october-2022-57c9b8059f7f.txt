A Facebook post claiming to show the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) controlling Shire, Adi Tesfa, Rama, and Daharo towns in the Tigray region is FALSE.
The post, in Amharic, was shared on 19 October 2022.
“Breaking news of victory !Today, our heroic defence forces controlled Shire, Adi Tesfu, Rama, and Daero,” the Amharic text with five images attached, reads when translated.
There were news reports on 18 October 2022 that the ENDF had taken control of the Shire, Alamata, and Korem from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, Tigray’s regional army.
PesaCheck reviewed the post and found it to be untrue.
Reverse image search results here, here, here, here, and here established that the pictures are not related to the renewed conflict in Ethiopia in 2022.
The first image is of ENDF soldiers on a truck in Wichale town, Amhara region, on 13 December 2021. The image is credited to Amanuel Sileshi/AFP via Getty Images.
The second image was published on the Pinterest website on 20 November 2017. The picture is of “Abandoned T-55 tank in Karlovac, Croatia.”
The caption accompanying the third image reads: “An Iraqi tank goes up in flames after being hit on 27 February 1991 in Iraq, by a TOW missile fired from the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division.” The image is credited to Tannen Maury/AP.
The fourth image is by Anadolu Agency photographer Minasse Wondimu Hailu and was taken on 16 December 2021. It is about the Ethiopian security forces patrolling a street after the national army took control of Hayk town of Amhara city from TPLF.
The text accompanying the last image states, “Ethiopian government soldiers ride in the back of a truck on a road near Agula, north of Tigray’s capital Mekele in May 2021.’’ The image is credited to Ben Curtis/AP.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show the Ethiopian National Defense Force controlling Shire, Adi Tesfa, Rama, and Daharo towns in the Tigray region and finds it to be FALSE.
