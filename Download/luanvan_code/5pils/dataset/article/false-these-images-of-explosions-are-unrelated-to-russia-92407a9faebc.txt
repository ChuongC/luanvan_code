This Facebook post with images claiming to show a major offensive launched by Russia is FALSE.
The Amharic text posted along a collage of three photos translates into, “Breaking News: Russia launched a major offensive.” The photos show burning buildings.
But as seen here, here, and here, Google reverse image search results reveal that the images are not related to Russia.
The first image was posted on the Workers World website on 17 April 2016. It shows “Saudi piloted U.S. warplanes bombing Yemen’s cities”. The image was published on different websites, as seen here and here.
The second image shows the Israel Defence Force’s (IDF) bombardment in Gaza. The picture was shared on the Ynet website on 14 March 2018. Also, the same image was published on this website on 9 March 2014.
The third image was used on the International Business Times website on 13 July 2015 in an article titled, “Syria: Assad regime barrel bombs kill at least 35 people in Aleppo.”
The description of the photo reads, “Syria: Video shows government forces dropping barrel bombs after denial.” The image is attributed to Reuters.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with images claiming to show a major offensive launched by Russia and finds it to be FALSE.
