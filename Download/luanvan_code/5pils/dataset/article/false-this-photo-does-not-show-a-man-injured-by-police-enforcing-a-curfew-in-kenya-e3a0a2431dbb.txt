A tweet with a photo claiming to show a man who had been injured by Kenyan police as they enforced the mandatory curfew in response to COVID-19 is FALSE.
The photo, which was also shared by Miguna Miguna, shows a man lying face down, showing scars on his back and a bandage on face, with the post suggesting that he sustained these injuries after being attacked by the police.
The image was shared along with other reported incidents of police assaulting citizens in various parts of the country in a bid to enforce the dusk-to-dawn curfew order that came into effect on the evening of March 27, 2020.
The curfew is one of several interventions by the government to limit the spread of COVID-19. However, the Kenyan police force has been criticised for using excessive force and has been urged to uphold human rights while enforcing the measures.
While there are many photos and videos showing the police using force to enforce the curfew, the photo in question is not one of them.
A reverse image search shows that it was taken in The Republic of Guinea and published on March 1, 2020 in Couleur Guinee, a Guinean news site. The man in the photo has been identified as Alpha Oumar Diallo, an 18-year-old merchant who was injured during protests inh Conakry by Guinea’s opposition against President Alpha Conde’s government.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo claiming to show a man injured by Kenyan police as they enforced a mandatory curfew and finds it to be FALSE.
