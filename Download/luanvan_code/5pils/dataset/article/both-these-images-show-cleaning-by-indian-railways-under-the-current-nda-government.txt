A collage of images is being shared on social media claiming it to be pictures comparing the technological advancements in the Indian Railways before and after the BJP government in the country. The first photo shows railway staff cleaning a platform manually using mops, whereas, the second picture shows the staff using machinery for sweeping the platform. Comparing the pictures, this post claims it as the testimony of ‘Ache Din’ in the country. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Images showing the technological upgrades in the Indian Railways before and after the BJP government in the country.
Fact: Both the pictures shared in the post were taken in 2020 during the BJP government in the country. The first picture shows railway staff cleaning a platform at the Howrah Junction railway station after the nearly seven-week lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020. The other photo shows the staff cleaning a platform of Asansol railway station, as part of the ‘Swachhta Saptah’ in August 2020. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Picture 1:
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, the same photo was found published on the ‘Alamy’ website in 2020. The description of the photo states, “Workers clean a platform at the Howrah Junction railway station after India announced a limited re-opening of its giant rail network beginning on Tuesday, after a nearly seven-week lockdown to slow the spreading of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), on the outskirts of Kolkata India, May 11, 2020.” The photo was originally published by ‘Reuters’ on 11 May 2020.
Picture 2:
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, the same photo was found tweeted by the ‘Eastern Railway’ on 13 August 2020. Eastern Railway tweeted the photo with a description, “Intensive cleaning of station platform, station adjacent area and track at Asansol on 13.8.2020 on the occasion of observance of ‘Swachhta Saptah’ from 10 to 16 August, 2020.”

To sum it up, these photos do not show the state of Indian Railways before and after the BJP government in the country.
