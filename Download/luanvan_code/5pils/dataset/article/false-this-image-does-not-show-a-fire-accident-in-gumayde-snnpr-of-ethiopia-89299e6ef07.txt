An image circulating on Facebook claiming to show a fire outbreak in Gumayde, the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia is FALSE.
“Look what an ethnic-based extremist group, under the pressure of the Southern region, has done. Unlike development, destruction will not help us. All of this is caused after the disintegration of the Segen Zone,” the post in Amharic reads.
In 2014, the People of Konso Woreda (district) started demanding to secede from the Segen Area People’s Zone Administration which they have been part of since 2011. They attained their demands in 2018, forming the Konso Zone. This resulted in a conflict between groups in support and opposed to the decision.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image is not related to Gumayde.
The image was shared on the Fana Broadcasting Corporate S.C. (FBC) verified Facebook page on 12 March 2022. “A fire broke out in a marketplace in Kola Diba town of Central Gondar Zone, causing property damage, according to the city administration,” part of the FBC report reads. Kola Diba is found in the Amhara region.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming to show a fire accident in Gumayde, the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ region of Ethiopia and found it to be FALSE.
