A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni dropping former speaker of parliament, Rebecca Kadaga, to a taxi stage is FALSE.
The post claims President Museveni drove Ms Kadaga, who served as Uganda’s speaker for 10 years, to a taxi stand where taxis heading to Kamuli District wait for passengers.
Kamuli is the home district of the former speaker and she has represented the area as Woman Member of Parliament since 1989. She recently won reelection.
The post came hours after her party, the National Resistance Movement, declined to endorse her candidature for the post of speaker of the 11th Parliament. The party instead backed her former deputy, Jacob Oulanya, ahead of the election slated for May 24, 2021, at the Kololo Ceremonial grounds in Kampala. Mr Oulanya carried the vote.
Uganda’s rules of procedure state that after the swearing-in of members of parliament, the first business conducted by the new parliament is the election of the speaker of parliament.
Ms Kadaga lost a tight contest for her party’s endorsement and then opted to run as an independent candidate.
The post, made on May 23, 2021, claims Ms Kadaga was being driven to her district’s stage by the president.
However, a Google reverse search of the image reveals that it was taken in 2019, when Ms Kadaga visited the president’s farm in Kisozi as seen here and here.
PesaCheck has looked into an image claiming to show Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni driving former speaker of parliament, Rebecca Kadaga, to a taxi stage and finds it to be FALSE.
