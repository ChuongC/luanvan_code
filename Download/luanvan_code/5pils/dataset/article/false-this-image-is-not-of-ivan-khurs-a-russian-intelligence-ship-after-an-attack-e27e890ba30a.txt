This tweet with an image purportedly of a Russian intelligence collection ship named Ivan Khurs after an attack is FALSE.
The tweet reads: “Russian intelligence collection ship Ivan Khurs after attack.”
On 25 May 2023, Ukraine’s Defence Ministry shared footage allegedly showing a Ukrainian drone attacking Russia’s Ivan Khurs reconnaissance ship in the Black Sea. The Russian Defence Ministry reportedly termed the attack “unsuccessful”. The warship returned to its base in Sevastopol, Crimea, on 29 May 2023.
A Google reverse search established that the image in the claim is of the USS Cole bombing in 2000 in Yemen.
The image taken in October 2000 was created on Getty Images on 6 October 2002 with the description: “A gaping hole mars the port side of the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Cole after a terrorist bomb exploded and killed 17 U.S. sailors and injured approximately 36 others during a refueling operation October 12, 2000 in the port of Aden, Yemen.”
The text adds: “Al-Qaeda’s chief of Persian Gulf operations, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, also known as “Al Maqqi,” has been captured, U.S. government officials said November 21, 2002. Al-Nashiri is believed to have been involved in planning numerous attacks, including the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen, officials said.”
