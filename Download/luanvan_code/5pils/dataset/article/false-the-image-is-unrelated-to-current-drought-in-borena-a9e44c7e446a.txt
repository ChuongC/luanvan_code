This tweet with an image supposedly of the current drought in Borena, the Oromia region of Ethiopia, is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by the text: “It breaks my heart to see young kids in this situation, struggling with no one to care for them and dying of hunger. I don’t know how to help, but I will do whatever I can. I ask all of you to join any effort to help Borana.”
Another internet user shared a similar claim here.
Different reports such as this and this, indicate that Borena is facing severe drought, a situation that has affected many people and their livestock.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the image in the claim is not from Borena.
The picture was published on this website on 22 July 2016. It is of malnourished siblings and their mother at a temporary camp for internally displaced people in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu in 2011.
As seen in the screenshot above, the caption reads: “An internally displaced woman attends to her malnourished children outside their makeshift shelter at a temporary camp in Hodan district of Somalia’s capital Mogadishu, Aug. 26, 2011.” Image credit is given to Reuters/Feisal Omar.
PesaCheck has examined the tweet with an image supposedly of the current drought in Borena, the Oromia region of Ethiopia, and found it to be FALSE.
