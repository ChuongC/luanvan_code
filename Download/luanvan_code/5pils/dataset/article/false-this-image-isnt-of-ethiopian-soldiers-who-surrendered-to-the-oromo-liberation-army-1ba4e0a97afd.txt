A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Ethiopian military forces who surrendered to the Oromo Liberation Army in western Oromia is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo post reads: “Good News: 153 commandos deployed by the government forces in western Oromia have surrendered to the Oromo Liberation Army. The commandos who were deployed in West Shoa Ambo were dispersed as soon as the fighting started.”
The Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) is an armed group fighting the Ethiopian government in the Oromia region.
Conflict, coupled with drought, has inflicted heavy humanitarian crises in the southern and western parts of Ethiopia’s Oromia regional state, according to the latest report by the UN Office of Coordination Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) on 11 November 2022. The violence has restricted transportation and distribution of humanitarian assistance to people in those areas.
However, Google reverse image search results indicate that the picture used to advance the claim is unrelated to the alleged surrender of Ethiopian soldiers to the Oromo Liberation Army in 2022.
The image is among the pictures accompanying an Amharic poem posted on the official Facebook page of the FDRE Defense Force in November 2020.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of Ethiopian soldiers who surrendered to the Oromo Liberation Army in western Oromia and finds it to be FALSE.
