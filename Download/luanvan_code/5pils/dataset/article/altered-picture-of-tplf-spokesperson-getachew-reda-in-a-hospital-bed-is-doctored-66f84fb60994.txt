An image, purportedly of Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) spokesperson Getachew Reda in a hospital bed is ALTERED.
“Gech’s [Getachew’s] last night in a hospital,” the headline of the post in Amharic shared on 25 October 2022 reads.
“The elders were left after they spent a night in hospital and after confirming that their request to get a referral to Canada had failed,” the post adds.

On 24 October 2022, Reuters reported that Getachew was part of a TPLF team headed to South Africa to participate in an African Union-led peace talk between the Tigray and the Ethiopian government.
PesaCheck established that the image of Getachew in a hospital bed is doctored.
The original image, according to Google reverse image search, is of a patient in a Johannesburg hospital.
The original image is credited to a Reuters photographer, Sumaya Hisham. It is of a coronavirus patient receiving treatment on 10 July 2021 at a Johannesburg hospital run by The Gift of the Givers, a charity in South Africa,.
The original image was digitally manipulated and the head of Getachew added to create the claim photo.
PesaCheck has investigated an image purportedly of TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda in a hospital bed and finds it to be ALTERED.
