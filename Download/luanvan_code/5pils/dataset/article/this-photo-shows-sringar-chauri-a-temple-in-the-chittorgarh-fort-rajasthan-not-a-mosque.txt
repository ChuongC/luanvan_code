A photo of a structure is being shared widely on social media with a claim that it shows a temple that has been converted into a mosque. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo shows a temple that has been converted into a mosque.
Fact: The posted photo is not related to a mosque. The photo shows Sringar Chauri, a temple in the Chittorgarh Fort (Rajasthan). Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, many similar photos were found in the search results. In 2020, when a social media user posted the same photo with a similar claim, another user replied saying that it is a temple called ‘Sringar Chauri’ at the Chittorgarh Fort in Rajasthan. Many similar photos of Sringar Chauri can be found on the internet. Some of them can be seen here, here, here, and here.
On the website of ‘Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA)’ of the Ministry of Culture, the documentation of the structure in the photo can be found.
