An image of a girl staring at a man in uniform is being shared widely on social media with a claim that it was taken at Jamia Protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: ‘Staring girl’ photo taken at Jamia Protests against CAA.
Fact: The photo in the post is an old one and  was taken in 2016 during a pro-democracy protest in Santiago (Chile). Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the photo was run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in an article by ‘The Sun’. In the article, the photo has the following description: ‘A demonstrator looks at a riot officer during protests in Chile in September 2016’. So, when searched with the relevant keywords, the same photo was also found in a CNN article, published in 2016. So, it is not related to any protests in India.
To sum it up, 2016 photo taken in Chile is being shared as a photo from Jamia Protests against CAA.
