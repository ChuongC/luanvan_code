A post with two images claiming to show the Russian Air Force entering Ukraine is FALSE.
Published on Facebook and written in Amharic, the post’s text translates, “Breaking News: the Russian Air Force entering Ukraine. The Russian Air force entered the second-largest city of Ukraine, Kharkiv.”
On 24 February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine, triggering condemnations and sanctions from different countries.
However, these photos used to advance a claim of the Russian troops entering Ukraine in 2022 are false. Reverse image search results here and here show that the pictures have been online since 2014 and 2021.
The NBC news website published the first image on 9 March 2014, in an article about Russian forces’ seizure of a Ukrainian border guard post in western Crimea. The picture is credited to Thomas Peter/ Reuters.
The second image was posted on the Euromaidan Press website on 6 May 2021, and it shows Russian Airborne Troops (VDV) boarding a military plane.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with images claiming to show the Russian Air Force entering Ukraine in 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
