An image shared on Facebook claiming to show the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) troops deployed in northern Russia is FALSE.
The post in Amharic has a headline that reads, “NATO has deployed its forces near Russia” adding “it claims that its movement is only for defense purposes”.
“NATO has deployed tens of thousands of troops in the northern part of Russia in the name of military exercises,” the post adds.
The post further says, “it has been reported that a military exercise, comprising 30,000 troops , 220 aircrafts and 50 warships will start this week, in Norway”.
NATO, a military alliance of 30 countries, strongly opposed the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 and denounced the act of aggression as “entirely unjustified and unprovoked”, adding that it constitutes a serious breach of international law.
On 14 March 2022, the organisation started a military exercise named “Cold Response 22”, involving 30,000 NATO troops and partner countries in Norway.
Although NATO conducts similar drills every year, the current exercise attracts media attention due to the escalating tension between the West and Russia over the war in Ukraine.
An image showing NATO’S armoured vehicles arriving in Norway on 10 March 2022 for the Cold Response 22 military exercise, was captured by AFP photographer Geir Olsen.
However, the image shared on Facebook claiming to show NATO troops in northern Russia is unfounded.
Google reverse image search results reveal that the image shows NATO and Ukraine military drills in 2021.
The image was originally captured by Associated Press photographer, Efrem Lukatsky, on 9 July 2021 in the Black Sea.
The photo shows NATO warships during joint military drills with Ukraine in the Black Sea on 9 July 2021.
PesaCheck has investigated an image shared on Facebook claiming to show NATO troops deployed in northern Russia and finds it to be FALSE.
