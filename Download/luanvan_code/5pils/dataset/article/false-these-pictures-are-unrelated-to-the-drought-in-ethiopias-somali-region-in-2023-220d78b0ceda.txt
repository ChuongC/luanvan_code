These pictures on Twitter and Telegram purportedly on the effects of drought in the Somali region of Ethiopia in 2023 are FALSE.
The text accompanying the picture on Twitter reads: “#liiban_zone #Dawa. This is a very difficult situation, children and women are at high risk of malnutrition. Malnutrition situation in the region is getting worse, humanitarian agencies should play their role in saving people.”
A Google reverse image search, however, established that the picture illustrating the claim is old and it was shared on this website on 23 February 2022.
Likewise, the pictures on this Telegram channel supposedly of the ongoing drought in the particular region are taken out of their context.
As seen here and here, the results from a Google reverse image search established that the photos were not taken in the Somali region in 2023.
The first image was published on the Voice of America (VoA) website on 1 February 2022 with the description: “Hussen Ahmed, 70, who says he lost seven cows and hopes his remaining 16 will survive, herds his animals after taking them from a distance to a pond at Beda’as Kebele, Danan woreda in the Shabelle zone of the Somali region of Ethiopia, Jan. 18, 2022.”
The second image was used on the Deutsche Welle (DW) website in 2017 to advance a report about the drought in the Somali region.
Ethiopia is one of the Horn of Africa countries experiencing severe drought, with thousands facing food shortages in the Somali region.
PesaCheck has examined the pictures on Twitter and Telegram, purportedly of the effects of drought in the Somali region of Ethiopia in 2023 and found them to be FALSE.
