An image shared on Facebook claiming to show General Muhoozi Kainerugaba’s campaign billboard is ALTERED.
The billboard shows General Muhoozi has declared interest in contesting for the presidency in 2026. Muhoozi serves as Land Forces commander in the Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF). He is also President Yoweri Museveni’s son.
The image caption, in Luganda, a local dialect, translates as, “We are in intense campaigns; please do not forget us in 2026”.
However, scrutiny of the billboard shows it has been edited by placing a new poster on the existing billboard. The edges of the poster are not well aligned on the billboard, raising suspicion about the post’s authenticity.
A Google reverse image search of the picture also reveals that the image is altered. The original image is a poster of President Museveni during the 2021 presidential elections campaigns. The image has existed online since November 2020.

Additionally, UPDF spokesperson, Brigadier General Flavia Byekwaso, told PesaCheck by telephone that the poster is fake.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming to show General Muhoozi Kainerugaba’s campaign billboard and finds it to have been ALTERED.
