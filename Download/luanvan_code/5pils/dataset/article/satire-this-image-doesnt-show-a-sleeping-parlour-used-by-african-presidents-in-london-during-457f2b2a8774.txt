A Facebook post with an image purporting to show a sleeping parlour used by African presidents in London during Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral is SATIRICAL.
The photo is of doubledecker beds lined up in a room. The caption reads: “African Presidents’ sleeping parlour in London.”
Several Heads of State gathered in London, United Kingdom, on 19 September 2022, for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral service. The service was attended by many high-profile guests.
For security reasons, the Heads of State were urged to fly commercial and carpool.
A photo of African Heads of State sharing a bus headed to the funeral service went viral on social media, with a section of netizens claiming that it was not a good show.
The post was shared online after the viral photo and purported that the African presidents would be sleeping on double-decker beds in a dormitory-kind of set up.
We conducted a reverse search on the image and established that it is from a dormitory at St George’s Girls Secondary School in Nairobi, Kenya, and not from London as alleged.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purporting to show a sleeping parlour used by African presidents in London, during Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral and finds it to be SATIRICAL.
