This Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) in a decisive offensive against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) force is FALSE.
The post adds that ENDF had taken control of two towns as of September 2022.
The Amharic post reads: “The heroic Ethiopian Defense Force and our Joint Army are taking strong action against the ‘Junta’ and have captured two cities. Victory to the Ethiopian Defence Force.”
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed describes TPLF as “Junta”.
After a five-month truce, fighting resumed on 24 August 2022 between the federal army and Tigrayan troops, each accusing the other of triggering the hostilities.
The air strike on Mekelle happened two days after the resumption of fighting and there are reports that an air strike hit a children’s play area, killing seven people in the capital of Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region on 27 August 2022.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture used to advance the claim is unrelated to the fighting in September 2022.
The image is among the pictures used to accompany an Amharic poem posted on the official Facebook page of Ethiopia’s Federal Defence Force on 28 August 2021. The post, however, does not mention an attack on TPLF forces.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) taking decisive action against TPLF troops and controlling two towns in September 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
