This tweet with an image purportedly of the bodies of Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God religious group members who died in a fire is FALSE.
The incident happened on 17 March 2000. The tweet claims that the photo is of the 778 members of the religious group who died in the inferno in the southwestern district of Kanungu, Uganda.

The religious movement was founded by Credonia Mwerinde and Joseph Kibweteere. In early 2000, followers of the religious movement perished in a fire and a series of poisonings and killings referred to in the media as the Kanungu Cult Massacre.
Although the incident explained in the tweet is factual, the image is not. A Google reverse image search established that the photo was taken in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), not in Uganda.
The graphic image of multiple burnt bodies is of the victims of an oil tanker explosion near Sange, South Kivu Province, DRC on 3 July 2010.
