No, Rahul Gandhi wasn’t having his lunch with Imran Khan. It’s a photoshopped image - FACTLY

An image is being shared on Facebook by some users claiming that Rahul Gandhi was dining with Imran Khan (Prime Minister of Pakistan). Let’s try to check the authenticity of the image posted.
Claim: Rahul Gandhi was seen eating with Imran Khan on the same dining table. 
Fact: It is a photoshopped image. In the original picture, Imran Khan’s wife can be seen sitting beside him on the dining table. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.    
When the image posted on Facebook is cropped (keeping only Imran Khan) and ran through Yandex Reverse Image search, the original picture can be found in the search results. In the original picture, beside Imran Khan, his wife Reham Khan can be seen. This photo is edited to misguide people.
When googled for Rahul’s photo that has been cropped and put alongside Imran Khan, it was found in “The Hindu” article. The photo was taken when Rahul Gandhi was having his food along with Karnataka’s the then CM Siddaramaiah at Indira Canteen in Jayanagar, Bengaluru in the year 2017.
Earlier, a similar claim of Modi eating with Imran Khan on the same dining table was shared on Facebook. Factly has debunked it and the article can be found here.
To sum it up, Rahul Gandhi was not having lunch with Imran Khan. It’s a photoshopped image.

Remove such false posts I am not in favor of such posts by any one .
