A photo of a boy locked up with chains is being widely circulated on social media with a claim that he was arrested for being a Muslim. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of the boy who was arrested for being a Muslim.
Fact: The boy in the photo was rescued by the Uttar Pradesh police when he was chained and locked in a Madrasa (a religious Islamic school) near Mangrauli Pulia Jewar. This photo was captured during that rescue operation in 2018. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image searching the photo using key words, a tweet posted by ‘Call 112’, emergency service portal of Uttar Pradesh was found detailing about the incident shown in the photo. In that tweet, they informed that the police of Gautham Buddha Nagar- PRV 1873 rescued a child who was chained and locked in a Madrasa (a religious Islamic school) near Mangrauli Pulia Jewar. The rescued child was taken to a local police station and later handed over to his parents.
