A Facebook post with an image claiming to show the body of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un lying-in-state is FALSE.
The image was shared along with the hashtag #Kim_jong_Hun_Officially_Dead, amid speculation about his health.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the photo is actually of Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il.
The image is credited to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) and was taken on 20th December 2011 at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang, a day after the country announced the death of Jong-il, who was the then leader of the country.
Jong-il ruled North Korea from 1994, following the death of his father and the founding leader of the country, Kim Il-sung, who is Kim Jong-un’s grandfather.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo claiming to show Kim Jong-un lying in state and finds it to be FALSE.
