A Facebook post with an image claiming to show an Ethiopian government airstrike in the Oromia region in October 2022 is FALSE.
The post reads: “The Ethiopian government has carried out Airstrikes in the Oromia region of Bosat, Fantale, Meta Welkite, Chobi, Nunu Qumba, and Gindeberet; Wave of the airstrike, at least more than a hundred citizens have been killed, including children, elders, and women. MIG-29 pilot on missions is 1. Colonel Bayana Worku 2. Hailemariyam Kase 3. Solomon. The operation was carried out with the military collaboration of Ethiopian and Eritrean, which base function from Asmara.”
On 25 October 2022, BBC Amharic reported that several people were killed in a drone strike at an Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) graduation ceremony in the West Shewa Zone of the Oromia region.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the image is unrelated to the Oromia region’s drone attack.
The 123ru.net website published the image on 15 November 2018 with a text that stated it was of a MiG-29 fighter flying through streets and courtyards in Lyubertsy, Russia.
The image was also published on this website on 26 September 2013, in an article headlined: “10 Little-Known Facts About the Factory That Makes MiG Warplanes.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of an Ethiopian government airstrike in the Oromia region in October 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
