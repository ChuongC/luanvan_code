An image shared on Facebook claiming to be of the newly appointed Kenya Pipeline Company Managing Director, Dr. Macharia Irungu is FALSE.
A reverse image search shows that the photo was shared by State House Kenya alongside 4 other images on November 11, 2019 during Lesotho Prime Minister Thomas Thabane’s state visit to Kenya.
PM Thabane arrived in Kenya on November 10 for a three-day state visit, and held a joint press briefing with President Uhuru Kenyatta on November 11. President Kenyatta and Dr. Thabane signed three agreements to establish a joint Commission for Cooperation, and a memorandum of understanding to develop sports as an economic activity.
On November 28, Cabinet Secretary for Mining, John Munyes announced Dr. Macharia Irungu as the new Managing Director for Kenya Pipeline Company Limited. Dr. Irungu’s previously the Managing Director of Gulf Africa Petroleum Corporation, and as a Commissioner at the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority. A look at Dr. Irungu’s photo shows that he is not the man shaking President Uhuru Kenyatta’s hand as claimed in the Facebook post.
PesaCheck has looked into the image claiming to show the newly appointed Kenya Pipeline Company Managing Director, Dr. Macharia Irungu and finds it to be FALSE.
