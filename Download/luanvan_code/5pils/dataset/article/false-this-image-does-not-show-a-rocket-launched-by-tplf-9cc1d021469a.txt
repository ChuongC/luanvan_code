A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a rocket attack by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) on 27 July 2021 is FALSE.
The post claims, “TPLF carried out an attack which was supported by a rocket yesterday. The Tigray force, which is about to control Weldiya, launched a rocket toward Kobo yesterday”.
With the rocket attack, the post adds, “things are getting intensified”.
“It is being said that a large number of Amhara militias are stationed in Weldiya, but when the TPLF army arrives in Weldiya, it could commit many massacres. The government must stop and think now, negotiation is the only option,” the Amharic post adds.
However, the Google reverse image search results show that this picture has been used by several websites previously. The image shows an anti-ballistic missile known as Aster Block 1 NT, that was launched in December 2015. It is currently in production and is expected to come into service in 2023. When this rocket is operational, it will form part of the French Air Force.
During the first months of the war in Tigray, TPLF, which has rebranded itself as the Tigray Defence Force (TDF), fired rockets that hit cities in the Amhara region. Similarly, TDF has fired rockets that hit Asmara, the Eritrean capital. However, there have been no reports of a rocket attack by TPLF during the past three months.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show a rocket launched by TPLF in July 2021 and finds it to be FALSE.
