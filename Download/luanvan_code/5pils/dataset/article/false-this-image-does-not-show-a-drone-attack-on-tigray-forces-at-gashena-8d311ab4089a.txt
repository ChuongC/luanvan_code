A Facebook post with a photo of a drone purportedly showing attacks on the Junta’s forces at Gashena is FALSE.
The Amharic post reads, “Shows the drones that have already started to destroy Junta at Gashena fronts”. Junta is a word used by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to refer to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, an ethnic nationalist paramilitary group.
The armed conflict between the TPFL and the Ethiopian National Defense Forces began in November 2020.
Despite the ongoing conflict, the photos used in the claim have nothing to do with the crisis in northern Ethiopia.
Google reverse image search results show that news websites used this picture before the Tigray conflict erupted.
The image was used by the Reuters news website on 23 February 2015, in the article, “Australia begins training on armed U.S Reaper drones”. The image caption describes the drone as the MQ-9 Reaper belonging to the US Air Force.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show a drone attack on Junta’s forces at Gashena and finds it to be FALSE.
