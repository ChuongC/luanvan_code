A tweet with a picture claiming to show army deployment in Nairobi, Kenya, on 9 August 2022 is FALSE.
In the picture, armed personnel in uniform similar to the Uganda Military Police walk in a single file. The author of the post writes: “Nairobi this afternoon”. The timestamp of the tweet shows it was published on 9 August 2022.
However, a Google reverse image search shows this picture was published on 19 March 2011 by the Daily Monitor in an article titled; “Politicians accuse the military of vote theft”. The accompanying caption reads; “Soldiers on foot-patrol in Kampala on voting day”.
KFM radio, a sister company of the Daily Monitor, also published the picture in 2018 in an article; “Don’t be worried about army men on the streets, Kampala is not a war zone”.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with a picture claiming to show army deployment in Nairobi on 9 August 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
