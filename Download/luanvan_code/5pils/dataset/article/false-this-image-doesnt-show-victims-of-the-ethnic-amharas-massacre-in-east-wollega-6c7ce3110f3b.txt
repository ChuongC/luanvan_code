This image shared on Facebook claiming to show mass killing of ethnic Amharas in East Wollega is FALSE.
“The mass killing of ethnic Amharas in Wollega is very disturbing. 40 Amharas were massacred by OLF in east Wollega, Kiramu Woreda, Horo Addis Alem Kebele. Moreover, tens of thousands have been displaced and living on the verge of death,” the post in Amharic reads in part.
Ethnic violence between Oromo and Amhara communities was reported on 10 October 2021, in East Wollega zone Kiramu woreda [in western Ethiopia], resulting in deaths and displacement of people.
The post we are fact-checking was shared on Facebook following the report.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal the image in the claim shows the bodies of victims of interregional forces conflict between Somali and Afar in May 2021.
The image was featured in a report titled “Ethiopia. The Afar Somali Region (formerly Ogaden) interregional conflict breaks out”, by Fulvio Beltrami, a freelance journalist. The report indicates that the conflict took place between 2–6 April 2021, and claimed the lives of many soldiers and civilians.
Similarly, the image was featured in “Situation Report EEPA HORN №121–07 April 2021” compiled by Martin Plaut, a senior journalist, regarding the major events that took place in Ethiopia and the region during the month of April 2021.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming to show victims of the ethnic Amharas massacre in East Wollega, Kiramu Woreda and finds it to be FALSE.
