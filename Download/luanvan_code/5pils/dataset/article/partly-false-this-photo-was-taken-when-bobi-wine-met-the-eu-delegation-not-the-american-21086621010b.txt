A Facebook post with an image claiming the American ambassador (to Uganda) has “finally” held talks with opposition politician Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine, is FALSE.
Bobi Wine, who came second in the January presidential election, has been under what police describe as preventative arrest.
This after he expressed dissatisfaction with the credibility of the election, promising his supporters a ‘plan B’, which the Ugandan government has interpreted as possible violence.
The high court ruled against Bobi Wine’s house arrest and ordered that security forces leave his premises. As such, a number of dignitaries have visited Bobi Wine at his home in Magere, including those from the European Union.
While the post correctly reports that Ambassador Natalie Brown held talks with Mr Kyagulanyi, which the US embassy also shared on their Facebook page, the image used was not taken in 2021, neither does it include the American diplomat.
The image used in this claim is from an August 2020 meeting between the politician and the European Union delegation.
PesaCheck has looked into a claim that a photo shared on Facebook was taken during US Ambassador Natalie Brown’s meeting with Bobi Wine and finds it to be FALSE.
