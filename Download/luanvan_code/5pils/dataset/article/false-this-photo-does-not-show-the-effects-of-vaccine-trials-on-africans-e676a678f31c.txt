A photo shared on Facebook with a text claiming that the individuals pictured are victims of a botched vaccine trial in Africa is FALSE.
The image shows children with deformed limbs; some are crawling while others walk with the aid of crutches.
The post does not identify the children or where they come from, and it also does not specify what kind of vaccine trial the supposed victims had taken part in.
The post appears to warn the public about the supposed dangers of taking part in any vaccine trials, adding that no one was held responsible for the claimed botched vaccine trial.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the picture has been published a number of times alongside articles and news reports about polio.
A further internet search shows that the image, credited to the WHO, is of children who survived polio and are from Cheshire Home for Handicapped Children, in Freetown, Sierra Leone that provides shelter, education and rehabilitation for polio-stricken children. It surfaced online on September 4, 2014.
Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that largely affects children under 5 years of age. It often causes permanent paralysis, usually of the legs of those infected. The disease has no known cure but can be prevented by immunization administered to children.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo that claims to show the effects of vaccine trials on Africans and finds it to be FALSE.
