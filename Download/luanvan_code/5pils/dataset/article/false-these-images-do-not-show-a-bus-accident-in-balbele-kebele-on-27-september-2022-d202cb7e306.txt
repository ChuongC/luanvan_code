This Facebook post with images claiming to show a bus accident in Balbele Kebele district on 27 September 2022 is FALSE.
The pictures are accompanied by an Amharic text that translates as; “Breaking news. Share. Sad news. According to the news from the region today, a public transport bus carrying 65 people from Addis Ababa to Hawassa overturned and 39 people died. Rest in peace. The accident took place at 12:20 this morning when the bus entered a 120-metre deep hole in the Balbele Kebele area. Since their identity is unknown, let’s contact them with their families. Their bodies are at Hawassa Referral Hospital. Their photos and IDs have been released on Telegram. Click the link and see.”
This and this are similar claims with the same images. The images attached to the post are digitally combined into one and form a single image.
But as seen here and here, results from a Google reverse image search established that the images are unrelated to the claim.
The first image was shared on the Gulf News website on 24 April 2022 and it is about an accident in Medina, Saudi Arabia. The accompanying caption reads: “The bus collided with a truck on the Al Hijrah highway, in Medina. Al Hijrah highway connects Mecca to Medina.”
As seen here and here, the same image was published on other websites too.
The other two pictures have previously been debunked by PesaCheck as they were used to advance a similar claim on 30 August 2022.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with images claiming to show a bus accident in Balbele Kebele district on 27 September 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
