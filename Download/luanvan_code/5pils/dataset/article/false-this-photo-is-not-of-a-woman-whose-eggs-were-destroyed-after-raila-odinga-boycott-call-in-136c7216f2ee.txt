This photo on Facebook and Twitter supposedly of a Kisumu woman whose eggs were destroyed after Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya leader Raila Odinga called for the boycott of some items on 10 March 2023 is FALSE.
Published on 11 March 2023, the photo was accompanied by a text claiming that protesters in Kisumu destroyed the woman’s eggs after the opposition leader asked Kenyans not to eat eggs.
Odinga, who spoke in Migori County on 10 March 2023, listed eggs as one of the products his supporters should boycott, adding that Azimio la Umoja will issue a list of more commodities and companies to boycott.
But was the photo taken on 11 March 2023 after Odinga’s Migori speech?
We performed a Google reverse search and established that the photo is not recent, as it has previously been used by several publications.
On 11 February 2021, the picture was shared by a Facebook page in Nigeria titled Alakada Comedy Skit.
On 10 June 2021, the photo was identified by a Nigerian publication as one of the trending memes on the internet.
On 27 January 2022, a tweet with the same image was published by a South African website.
In all the three instances the photo was used, there is no mention of mass protests in Kenya.
Pesacheck has looked into a photo on Facebook and Twitter claiming to show a Kisumu woman whose eggs were destroyed after Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya leader Raila Odinga called for a boycott of some products on 10 March 2023 and found it to be FALSE.
