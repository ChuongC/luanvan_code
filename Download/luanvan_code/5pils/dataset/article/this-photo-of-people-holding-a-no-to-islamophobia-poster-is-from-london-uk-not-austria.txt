In the context of the recent gun attack in Vienna (Austria), a photo showing people holding a poster – ‘No to Islamophobia’ is being shared on social media. In the post, it is being claimed that the photo was taken in Austria. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of people holding ‘No to Islamophobia’ poster in Austria.
Fact: The photo in the post was taken in London (UK) in 2017, not in Austria. While there were both pro and anti-refugee rallies in Austria previously, the posted photo is not related to them. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the image in the post was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in an article published by ‘Al Jazeera’. In the article, the photo credit is given to ‘Matt Dunham/AP’. So, when we searched using relevant keywords, the same photo was found on the ‘AP Images’ website. On the website, the following description is seen with the image – ‘People hold up a banner during a ‘Unity Vigil’ against racism and Islamophobia in reaction to Wednesday’s attack, backdropped by the gates of Downing Street in London, Friday, March 24, 2017’.
Also, the location in the photo can be seen in the street view of Downing Street in London. 
They were both pro and anti-refugee rallies in Austria previously. But the posted photo is not related to them.
To sum it up, the posted photo of people holding a ‘No to Islamophobia’ poster is from London (UK), not Austria.
