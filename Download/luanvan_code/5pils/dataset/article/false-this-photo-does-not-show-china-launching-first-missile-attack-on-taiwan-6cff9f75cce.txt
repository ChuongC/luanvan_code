A Facebook post with an image claiming to show China’s first missile strike in Taiwan is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates as; “China launches the first kind missile to Taiwan. China’s long and short-range ballistic missiles, named Dongfang, were fired into the Taiwan Strait, and the extent of damage is not known yet.”
On 4 August 2022, the BBC reported that China fired a barrage of ballistic missiles into the waters around Taiwan in response to United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the self-ruled island.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the claimed photo is unrelated to China’s offensive against Taiwan.
The original image shows “a warship launching a US-made Harpoon missile during the annual “Han Kuang” (Han Glory) military drill” in the sea near Taiwan on 15 July 2020. The image is credited to Taiwan’s Defence Ministry.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show China launching first missile attack on Taiwan and finds it to be FALSE.
