These images shared on Facebook claiming to show trucks that were attacked while moving from Tigray to the Afar region are FALSE.
“18 Trucks that were carrying thousands of Junta fighters were destroyed along with the gunmen by the air force while moving from Tigray to Afar region,” the post in Amharic reads.
However, Google reverse image search results, as seen here, here, and here, reveal that the images show different events outside of Ethiopia.
The first image was published on the Independent Online website on 10 July 2021, in an article about protesters — believed to be Jacob Zuma’s supporters — who burned and looted trucks. The protesters showed their solidarity for Zuma, the former South African president and demanded his release from jail.
The second image shows a fuel tanker explosion in the Afghanistan-Iran border area. The Guardian posted the photo on 13 February 2021 in an article dubbed: “Huge blasts on Afghanistan-Iran border spotted from space”.
The third image was published on the Aero Time Hub website on 5 October 2020 and shows a Su-35 fighter jet as it was being tested.
The conflict in northern Ethiopia, almost a year old, has intensified, and humanitarian assistance has been disrupted in the latest airstrikes in Mekelle, the Tigray capital. However, none of the above images has any relation to the incidents in northern Ethiopia.
PesaCheck has looked into Facebook images claiming to show trucks that were attacked while moving from Tigray to the Afar region and finds them to be FALSE.
