A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a machine gun destroyed in the ongoing war in North Ethiopia in September 2022 is FALSE.
“Information I obtained from Raya front via telephone,” the headline of the Amharic post shared on 11 September 2022, reads.
“The TPLF militants are loading all properties at Gobiye. The sound of heavy artillery was heard yesterday from allied forces,” part of the post reads.
“TPLF was using a poisonous weapon that has been banned in international war law. This artillery has been destroyed by now. The artillery is known as Sharpener and has a capacity of shooting up to 500 nail looking poisonous bullets at once,” the post adds.
The post is accompanied by an image of a weapon placed on a damaged truck.
Gobiye and Hara are places in North Wollo, Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. Fighting has been reported around Kobo, north Wollo state, between federal government-allied forces and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) since the conflict resumed in late August 2022.
Reuters reported that the federal government forces carried out drone attacks in Mekelle, Tigray regional capital, on 13 September 2022. Earlier, Reuters reported that Tigray forces had offered a ceasefire.
However, our investigation shows that the image isn’t that of TPLF artillery destroyed in the ongoing war in September 2022.
Google reverse image search results established that the image was captured during the war in the Tigray region in July 2021.
Image credit is given to Reuters photographer Giulia Paravicini and is dated 10 July 2021. The image shows a machine gun on a truck that was burnt out on the road to Abiy Addi town on 10 July 2021, where fighting was reported.
Abiy Addi is a town in Ethiopia’s central Tigray region.
PesaCheck has investigated a Facebook post with an image claiming to show TPLF artillery destroyed on the battlefield in September 2022 in northern Ethiopia and finds it to be FALSE.
