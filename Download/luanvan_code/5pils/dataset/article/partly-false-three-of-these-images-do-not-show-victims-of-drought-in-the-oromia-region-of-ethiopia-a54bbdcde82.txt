This tweet with images claiming to show drought victims in Ethiopia’s Oromia region is PARTLY FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates as; “The United Nations and other international organisations should reach out to the Oromo people who are suffering from hunger.”
To advance the claim, four images are attached to the post. However, as seen here, here, here, and here, Google reverse image search results established that three of the images are unrelated to the drought in Oromia.
The first image was shared on this website on 3 July 2018 to support an article about children who were affected by diarrhoea in camps of internally displaced people in Nigeria.
The photo has previously been posted on other websites as seen here and here.
The second image has, since 2009, been published on various websites. It was taken in 1993 in Southern Sudan by Kevin Carter.
The third image was posted on Facebook on 19 May 2022 alongside a text stating that it is of a woman who collapsed due to hunger in Mekelle. The same image was posted on Twitter with a similar description.
As seen here and here, the fourth image was used by different netizens alongside other pictures to show the drought in Oromia.
Although there have been reports of drought in Oromia in 2022, three of the images used to advance the claim are unrelated to the situation in the Ethiopian region.
PesaCheck has examined a tweet with images claiming to show victims of drought in the Oromia region of Ethiopia and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
