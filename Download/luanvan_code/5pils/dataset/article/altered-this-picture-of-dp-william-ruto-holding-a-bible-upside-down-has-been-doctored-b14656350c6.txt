A photo shared on Facebook showing Deputy President William Ruto holding a Bible upside down is ALTERED.
The image is accompanied by text implying that DP Ruto is not an honest man.
This, therefore, begs the question, was DP Ruto photographed holding the Bible upside down?
Research by PesaCheck shows that the picture has been manipulated to create the impression that the DP is holding the Bible upside down.
A reverse image search shows that the photo has been used in a March 25, 2020, article by TUKO. The original photo has the DP holding the Bible correctly and not upside down, with the wordings on the back cover, as shown in the image with the claim.
A search on Yandex also shows that the same image was used in another article in April 2021, with the DP holding the Bible upright.
PesaCheck has looked into the authenticity of a photo shared on Facebook showing Deputy President William Ruto holding a Bible upside down and finds that it has been ALTERED.
