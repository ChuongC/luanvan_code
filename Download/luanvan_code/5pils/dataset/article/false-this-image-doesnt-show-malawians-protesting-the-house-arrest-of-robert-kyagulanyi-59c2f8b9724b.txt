A tweet with an image claiming to show Malawians hitting the streets of Lilongwe to protest the house detention of a former presidential candidate in Uganda, Robert Kyagulanyi, is FALSE.
The post has an image of a convoy of vehicles and men clad in black T-shirts, who appear to be staging a protest, while another man delivers a speech from the sunroof of one of the cars, flanked by civilians and security operatives.
The tweet urges Ugandans to “rise up and liberate their own” and thanks Malawians for their solidarity towards Mr Kyagulanyi. The same claim has been published on Facebook and here.
However, a Google reverse image search shows the photo was first shared in 2020 and does not depict events from January 2021 as claimed in the tweet. The image was taken in Blantyre, Malawi, and was first shared online by the Citizens for Transformation (CFT) leader Timothy Pagonachi Simbega Mtambo on his Facebook page.
The National Unity Platform (NUP) party leader, who is also known as Bobi Wine, has been under house-arrest since the presidential elections were held on January 14 to date.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image claiming to show Malawians hitting the streets of Lilongwe to protest the house detention of Uganda’s Robert Kyagulanyi, and finds it to be FALSE.
