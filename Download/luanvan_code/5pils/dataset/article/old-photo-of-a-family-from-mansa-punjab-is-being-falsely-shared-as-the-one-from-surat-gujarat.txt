Photo of a family having their tea while sitting in floodwater is doing the rounds on social media claiming that the incident happened in Surat, Gujarat. The same photo is also being shared (archived) as that of Delhi. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of a family having their tea while sitting in flood water in Surat, Gujarat.
Fact: The photo is captured in Mansa (Punjab), not Surat (Gujarat). Also, the photo is old and is taken in 2016. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When we subjected the photo to reverse image search technique, a tweet of Barnala constituency (Punjab) MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer was found. The tweet is dated ‘18 July 2016’ and it is mentioned in the tweet that the photo is captured at Mansa district of Punjab.

In the comments section of that tweet, a user attached a news article from the e-paper of ‘Punjab Kesari’ that had the same photo as that in the post. The article also mentioned that the photo was taken in ‘Mansa’.
Other Facebook posts mentioning that the photo is taken at ‘Mansa’ can be seen here and here.
To sum it up, an old photo of a family from Mansa (Punjab) having their tea while sitting in flood water is being shared as in Surat (Gujarat).
