A Facebook post with an image of a burning vehicle and claiming the car was set ablaze by Kenyan bodaboda riders is FALSE.
The post indicates that the bodaboda riders shouted “Choma Dynasty” — a political slur — while torching the car, and attributes the incident to the “hustler vs dynasty” narrative.
The narrative pits politicians from humble backgrounds, which Deputy President William Ruto identifies with, against those from privileged families that have ruled the country for decades, including President Uhuru Kenyatta and political leader Raila Odinga.
However, while multiple incidents have been reported previously, all attributed to growing animosity between ‘hustlers vs dynasties’ across the country, the image has nothing to do with the political discourse in Kenya.
A Google image reverse search reveals that the photo circulating on Facebook is in fact of an accident that occurred along the A19 road in the UK.
Gazette Live news website reported that the accident took place in 2015, causing a severe traffic disruption on the A19 after the car fire.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a car burnt down by Kenyan bodaboda riders and finds it to be FALSE.
