This Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone destroying Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces travelling from Mekelle to the Tenben desert is FALSE.
“Breaking: The TPLF group, which was travelling from Mekelle to Tenben desert, was destroyed by a drone at a place called Adinifas. It is being said that the top leaders of the TPLF were also there,” the post in Afaan Oromo, shared on Facebook, reads.
The war between the Ethiopian federal government and TPLF resumed full scale on 24 August 2022.
On 11 September 2022, Ethiopia’s Tigray Forces said they were ready for a ceasefire, and would accept a peace process led by the African Union, to end the war that has stretched for almost two years.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the image we are fact-checking is not related to a drone attack in the Tigray region.
The image was published on the Flying Tigers website on 20 May 2016, with the description, “Mig 23 Flogger Fighter Interceptor, Ground Attack”.
The image was also posted on the Islamic Invitation Turkey website on 5 July 2020, alongside an article titled, “Libyan Army bombs large airbase as Turkish Defense Minister visits Libya.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a drone destroying TPLF forces headed to the Tenben desert from Mekelle and finds it to be FALSE.
