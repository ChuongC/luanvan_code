A Facebook post with an image claiming to be of a weapon seized by the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) at Begi town, western Oromia, is FALSE.
The image was shared alongside Afaan Oromo text that translates to; “Yesterday the Oromo Liberation Army captured a Zu-23 weapon in western Oromia at Begi town.”
Begi town is in the West Wollega Zone of the Oromia regional state.
OLA, referred to as “OLF-Shene” by the Ethiopian government, has been fighting Federal government forces in the Oromia regional state. The Ethiopian parliament designated OLA as a terrorist group in May 2021.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the photo is not of a weapon captured by the Oromo Liberation Army at Begi town.
The image is of a Soviet-made ZU-23 twin 23 mm automatic anti-aircraft gun seized during Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada in 1983.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly of a weapon seized by the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) at Begi town in Oromia regional state, and finds it to be FALSE.
