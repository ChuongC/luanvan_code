A Facebook post with a photo showing a person praying in the middle of a road and surrounded by lions, is ALTERED.
The person is in a praying posture — kneeling on a prayer mat with his face to the ground — in the middle of the road, with a dozen lions surrounding him, and with vehicles in the background, suggesting traffic came to a standstill at the time. The text on the post says “Islam is the only true Religion on the earth”.
However, a Google reverse image search found the original image in an article published in India Today in 2019, when lions from the Kruger National Park, South Africa, stopped traffic on the road.
The original image does not show anyone on the road, only a group of lions resting in the road.
Further investigation leads to a video on YouTube that puts the incident in context. The lions were filmed at the intersection of the H1–3 and the S126 road close to Satara and Sweni Water Hole in Kruger National Park, in South Africa, on November 25, 2016.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo showing a person kneeling on a prayer mat in the middle of the road surrounded by a pride of 12 lions and finds it to be ALTERED.
