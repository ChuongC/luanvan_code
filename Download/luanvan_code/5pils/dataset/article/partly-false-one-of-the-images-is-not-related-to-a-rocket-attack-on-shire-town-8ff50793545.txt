A tweet with images claiming to show the aftermath of a rocket attack on Shire Town is PARTLY FALSE.
The tweet reads: “Eritrean/Ethiopian rocket attack on Shire Town, #Tigray injured several children.”
However, as seen here and here, Google reverse image search results showed that one of the images is not related to the rocket attack on Shire Town.
The first image was previously shared on this website with a description that says, “Kharkiv, Ukraine: 24 March 2022 — Unexploded rocket launcher BM-21 “Grad” on the Saltovsky massif in Kharkiv.” The photo credit is Fotoreserg.
The second picture was published on Dimtsi Weyane’s Facebook page and YouTube channel in relation to the attack in Shire Town on 8 October 2022.
The war, which began in November 2020 in some northern parts of Ethiopia, is yet to be resolved. On 14 October 2022, it was reported that an airstrike in Shire Town killed three people including an aid worker. Peace talks between the Tigray forces and the federal government, facilitated by the African Union, started on 24 October 2022 in South Africa.
PesaCheck has examined the tweet with images claiming to be of the aftermath of a rocket attack on Shire Town and found it to be PARTLY FALSE.
