An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg at his ranch is FALSE.
The photo shows the back view of Mr Zuckerberg as he looks at a herd of cattle. Besides owning Facebook, Zuckerberg is also a “herdsman”, the post states.
However, a Google reverse image search reveals that the CEO was not photographed at his ranch as claimed in the Facebook post. One of the search results is a July 26, 2017 article published on Tri-State Livestock News (TSLN) containing the image in question. The article reports that Zuckerberg had visited the Norman ranch in Piedmont, South Dakota.
A search through Mr Zuckerberg’s Facebook timeline shows that he posted the image in question on July 13, 2017. The photo is among two others of his visit to the ranch.
“I had lunch today with the Norman family on their 2,500-acre cattle ranch in South Dakota,” reads Mr Zuckerberg’s post, which expresses gratitude to the ranchers for the work they do, “not just feeding the country (the US), but helping provide things like insulin, leather and makeup ingredients that also come from cattle”.
PesaCheck has looked into the image claiming to show Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg at his ranch and finds it to be FALSE.
