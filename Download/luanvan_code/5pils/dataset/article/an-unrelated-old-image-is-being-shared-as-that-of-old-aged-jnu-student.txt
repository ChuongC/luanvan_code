An image is being shared widely on Facebook claiming it to be that of an old aged student of JNU participating in the protests. Let’s try to check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image of old aged Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student protesting.
Fact: The image shows Police arresting a woman who had participated in a protest demanding for minimum wage at Labour Commissioner Office in Hyderabad in 2017. So, the claim is FALSE.
From the article of ‘The Hindu’, it can be found that, since the past few days, students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi are protesting demanding the withdrawal of draft hostel manual and proposed hike in the hostel fees.
When the image in the post is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, many search results were obtained. Among them, the search result of ‘Outlook’ had the same image in its article with a set of photos. The image in the post is 14th among the 108 photos in that article and the description seen with it is- ‘Police arrests a woman who was participating in a protest demanding for minimum wage, at labour Commissioner Office in Hyderabad’. This image was captured on 19th September 2017.
To summarize, an unrelated 2-year-old image is being shared as that of an old aged student of JNU participating in the protests.
