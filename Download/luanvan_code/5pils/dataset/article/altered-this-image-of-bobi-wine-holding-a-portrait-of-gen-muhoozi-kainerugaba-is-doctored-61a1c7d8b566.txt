This image, shared on Facebook, claiming to show Ugandan opposition politician Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, holding a portrait of First Son General Muhoozi Kainerugaba is ALTERED.
In the altered photo, three people — among them Bobi Wine — hold a portrait with the face of Kainerugaba and the words; “More Years of Peace, The Next Leader”.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image was altered.
The original image, as seen on Bobi Wine’s official Facebook page, was taken when the Ugandan politician met mayor Andry Sadovy of Lviv, during a visit to the western Ukrainian city. In the image, Bobi Wine, Andry Sadovy and an unidentified man hold a portrait of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with the image of Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine and two others holding a portrait of First Son General Muhoozi Kainerugaba and finds it to have been ALTERED.
