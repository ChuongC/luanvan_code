An image used to advance a claim that the Ethiopian Air Force attacked the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces is FALSE.
Published on Facebook on 26 August 2022, the photo is accompanied by Amharic text translated as; “Breaking News: Ethiopian air force made a frontal attack in Mehoni, Mekele, Kobo, and Afar and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. In particular, Kobo’s front was loaded with three tracks and the enemy force that was travelling from front to front was reduced to ashes.”
The war in Ethiopia, between the Federal Government and the TPLF, resumed in the morning of 24 August 2022.
Google reverse image search results show that the picture was published online before the conflict resumed in August 2022.
Russia News Agency published the image on 19 February 2008 alongside an article titled: “Russia’s Su-35: prized state-of-the-art fighter, battle-tested in Syrian skies”.
The caption indicates that the image is that of Su-35 and Su-57 fighter jets. The photo has the copyright of Marina Lystseva/TASS.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attacking Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces and finds it to be FALSE.
