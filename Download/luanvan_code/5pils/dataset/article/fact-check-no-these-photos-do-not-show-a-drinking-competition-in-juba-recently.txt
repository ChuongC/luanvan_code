A Facebook post by Juba Media claiming that a drinking competition was held in Juba is false.
The post, which featured photos of some women drinking from the bottles of Heineken, asked people about who they thought would have won.
“We had a drinking competition last night in Juba. Who do you think won”? reads the post without mentioning where the event was held in Juba and which company organised it.

However, when the photos were verified by 211 Check using Google image lens, it appeared that it was tweeted on the Twitter handle Kulani on September 7th, 2022. And the tweet did not mention any drinking competition that took place in Juba. 

Also, the tweet, which generated 107 retweets, 56 quote tweets, and 529 reactions, did not describe the purpose and the location of the photos where the event took place.
Typically brewery companies that sell drinks like beer organise drinking competitions as part of their marketing strategy campaign to promote their brands, and it attracts crowds involving entertainment.
But no such event had occurred recently in Juba, as the Juba Media Facebook post claimed.
Conclusion:
The Facebook post by Juba Media on the 30th of November 2022 that the drinking competition took place in Juba over the weekend is false. A public event of such has yet to be held recently.
This fact-check was published as part of an assignment for the Empowering Fact-checking in South Sudan (EFiSS) Training Program by 211 Check.
