A tweet with an image purportedly showing the border bridge linking Uganda and Kenya is FALSE.
But a Google reverse image search reveals that the picture shows the newly constructed two-lane border bridge over the Cross River at the Nigeria/Cameroon border at Mfum/Ekok and Joint Border Post.
The bridge, a project under the Transport Facilitation Programme for the Bamenda-Enugu Corridor, otherwise known as the Nigeria/Cameroon Multinational Highway and Transport Facilitation Programme (NCMH & TFP), was officially commissioned on 3 November 2022 by President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria and his Cameroonian counterpart Paul Biya.
The Kenya-Uganda One Stop Border Post is at Busia.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image purportedly of the border bridge linking Uganda and Kenya and finds it to be FALSE.
