A Facebook post claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force troops en route to the Tongo Kebele in the Benishangul-Gumuz region is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo text accompanying the photo translates to; “Share this information. Prosperity party is taking its Air Force to the Tongo Kebele. This place is in the Benishangul Gumuz region, bordering the Begi city of West Wollega Oromia. The air force is coming because the ground force has lost its way in.”
Tongo SW Zone is in Ethiopia’s Benishangul-Gumuz region.
A kebele is a small administrative unit in Ethiopia.
Media reports indicate that an aerial offensive carried out by government forces on 9 November 2022 killed dozens of individuals in Mendi town, West Wellega Zone. Civilians were also killed in a clash between Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) combatants and government forces in Nekemte, the capital of East Wellega Zone.
A Google reverse image search, however, established that the picture has previously been published online and is unrelated to the Ethiopian conflict in November 2022.
The Insider website published the image on 5 November 2015, with the caption, “An Mi-24 helicopter, the same model being used for tours in North Korea.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force heading to the Tongo Kebele in the Benishangul-Gumuz region and finds it to be FALSE.
