An image posted on Facebook said to be of Ethiopia preparing to install its second satellite is ALTERED.
The image is of a satellite with the Ethiopian flag imprinted at the top. The post in Afaan Oromo shared on 18 November 2022 translates to; “Ethiopia is preparing to install the second satellite. The first satellite is working well.”
On 19 December 2019, Ethiopia’s first-ever earth observatory satellite was launched into space. The Ethiopian Remote Sensing Satellite (ETRSS-1), which will be used to gather data for agricultural, mining, and environmental protection, was sent into space from the Taiyuan space base in northern China. The country’s second satellite was launched in December 2020.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the image is digitally manipulated.
The original image is of a “Top view of #PSLVC48, prominently featuring the bulbous payload fairing that houses #RISAT2BR1 & 9 customer satellites.” The satellite was scheduled to be launched at “1525 hrs IST on 11 December 2019”.
The image, published on the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) official Twitter account on 9 December 2019, does not have the Ethiopian flag.
PesaCheck has examined an image shared on Facebook claiming to be of Ethiopia preparing to launch its second satellite and finds it to be ALTERED.
