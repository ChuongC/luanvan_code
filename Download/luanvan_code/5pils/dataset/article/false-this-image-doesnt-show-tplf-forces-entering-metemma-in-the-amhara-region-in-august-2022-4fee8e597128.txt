This Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces entering Metemma from the direction of Sudan in August 2022 is FALSE.
The translation of a part of the Amharic post shared on 20 August 2022 reads:
“Breaking information: A large number of TPLF forces are entering Metemma from the Sudan route. 20 August 2022: local residents confirmed that TPLF forces with heavy modern weapons entered west Gondar Metemma Yohannes town from Sudan route.”
The post adds: “It is recalled that Getachew Reda, the TPLF spokesperson, announced recently that the ceasefire has ended.”
An image of the marching soldiers, with the one at the front holding the TPLF flag, accompanies the post.
In June 2022, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced that his government had established a committee to negotiate with Tigray forces to resolve the conflict that erupted in November 2020.
On 17 August 2022, the already established peace committee proposed a complete ceasefire to be concluded between the government and Tigray forces for peace facilitation.
However, on the same day, TPLF’s spokesperson Getachew Reda responded by accusing the government of engaging in “obfuscation and defying” the promise to take needed measures.
Getachew escalated the accusation on 18 August 2022 at a press conference [minute 11:52] with the announcement that “the ceasefire has been technically ended as the government forces have attacked TPLF forces using artillery”.
The post refers to this statement by Getachew.
Nevertheless, the image attached to the post claiming to show TPLF forces entering Metemma, a border town in the Amhara region in August 2022, is unfounded.
Results of a reverse image search indicate that the image is from June 2021, when Tigray forces regained Mekelle, the region’s capital.
The image was captured by Agence France-Presse (AFP) photographer Yasuyoshi Chiba on 30 June 2021 and it shows TPLF fighters marching in Mekele, after regaining the region.
PesaCheck has investigated a Facebook post with an image claiming to show TPLF forces entering Metemma from the direction of Sudan in August 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
