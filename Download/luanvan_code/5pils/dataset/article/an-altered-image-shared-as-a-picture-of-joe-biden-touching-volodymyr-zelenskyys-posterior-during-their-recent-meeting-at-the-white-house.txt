In the wake of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyyâ€™s visit to Washington this week, a photo is being circulated on social media claiming it to be a picture of US President Joe Biden grabbing Volodymyr Zelenskyy by his posterior while posing for a photo at the White House. Letâ€™s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Joe Biden grabbing Volodymyr Zelenskyy by his posterior during the recent meeting at the White House.
