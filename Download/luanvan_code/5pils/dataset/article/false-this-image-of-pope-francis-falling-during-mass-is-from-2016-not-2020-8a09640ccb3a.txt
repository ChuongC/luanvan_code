A photo shared alongside a Facebook post claiming that Pope Francis had lost his balance and fell down during mass on 26th March has been taken out of context and is FALSE.
According to the post, the Pope was taken to Salvator Mundi International Hospital after the fall, and he tested positive for COVID-19. It adds that his seven helpers have put themselves in 14-day self-quarantine.
However, a reverse image search shows that the photo published alongside the post was taken in July 2016, when the head of the Catholic Church fell at the altar of the Jasna Gora Monastery in Częstochowa, Poland while celebrating mass.
Pope Francis has not tested positive for coronavirus, and held a service at an empty St Peter’s Square in the Vatican on 28 March, three days after the post was published.
According to the Holy See’s Press Office, there are currently four confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Vatican and not 14 as claimed. The latest cases include an employee of the merchandise office and two workers from the Vatican Museums.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo of Pope Francis falling due to COVID-19 and finds it to be FALSE.
