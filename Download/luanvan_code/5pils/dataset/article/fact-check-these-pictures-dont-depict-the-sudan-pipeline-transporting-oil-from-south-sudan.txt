Fact-check: These pictures don’t depict the Sudan pipeline transporting oil from South Sudan - 211CHECK

Publication Date:2023-04-17T13:52:03+00:00
These pictures were first used in India in 2015 and 2018; therefore, they’re not from Sudan
Writer: Jibi Moses
Sixty 4 Tribes Press, a Facebook page, published an article accompanied by two pictures of pipelines, the other on fire. The page claimed that locals in Port Sudan had set Sudan pipelines carrying South Sudan oil ablaze. 
The Facebook post attracted over 160 reactions, 60 comments and 49 shares, but it is false.

Investigation:
211 Check carried out a reverse image search on the pictures, and the results showed images from different locations. One of the images was first used by an Indian Press, Energyworld.com, explaining the Bhilai Steel Plant Blast in a blog published on October 10, 2018. 
Other instances were the Bhilai steel plant blast, and the images used are shown here, here, here, and here.
Oilprice.com Nasdaq used the second image on Dec 3rd 2015. After that, many other sources have used it in their articles, as seen in links 1,  2, and 3. The photo is used as a stock image on the internet
Conclusion:
211 Check finds the claim that locals have razed down pipelines in Sudan carrying South Sudan is false. The pictures shared are not of the Sudan pipeline carrying South Sudan’s oil being set ablaze; they trace their origin back to 2015 and 2018, respectively, with one of an incident of the Bhilai steel plant blast in Chhattisgarh, India, not in Sudan.
