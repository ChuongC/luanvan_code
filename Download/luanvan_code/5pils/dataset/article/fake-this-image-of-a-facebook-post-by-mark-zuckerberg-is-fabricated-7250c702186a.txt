A Facebook post with a screenshot of a post attributed to the chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, criticising the ban on the social media company in an unidentified African country is FAKE.
According to the screengrab, Mr Zuckerberg also criticises an unnamed ‘dictator’ of the said country, saying that Facebook does not have an office there. The text is full of grammatical errors.
The screenshot was shared amidst reports that Uganda has restricted social media platforms and shut down the internet ahead of the general election in the country on January 14, 2021.
However, while the timestamp on the screengrab shows that the post was shared on January 12, 2021, a search on Mr Zuckerberg’s Facebook timeline shows he never shared any post on that date.
Mr Zuckerberg’s latest post was shared on January 10, 2021, when he celebrated the work anniversary of the company’s vice president of augmented and virtual reality, Andrew Bosworth.
By January 14th, Mr Zuckerberg was yet to share another post on his timeline.
This alleged criticism by the head of the social media giant would have attracted widespread media attention, but no credible organization has reported this.
In an email response to PesaCheck, Facebook’s communications manager for East Africa, Ms Janet Chepkosgei Kemboi, dismissed the screenshot as ‘false.’
PesaCheck has looked into the screenshot of a post by Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, criticising the ban of the social media company in an unidentified African country, and finds it to be FAKE.
