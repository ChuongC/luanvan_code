This photo on Twitter purportedly of Kenyan President William Ruto with the royal family at Buckingham Palace has been ALTERED.
The tweet claims Ruto imposed himself on what was meant to be a family-only shoot at Buckingham Palace following the coronation of King Charles III. The new king was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 6 May 2023.
The photo has King Charles waving at the crowd from the balcony accompanied by his wife, Queen Camilla, and other royals. Ruto is at the far right of the altered photo.
The tweet implies the Kenyan leader’s presumptuousness in joining a family-only photo.
The picture is also shared on Facebook, which claims that Ruto was the only leader invited to join the royal family at the Buckingham Palace balcony.
However, the photo is suspicious given the absence of other non-royals and Ruto’s positioning.
A Google image reverse search to determine the authenticity of the image brings up a photo from the coronation day. The image is used in an article on the coronation and is credited to Reuters via photographer Matthew Childs.
While the rest of the details are identical, Ruto is not featured in the photo with the exception of the part where he has been digitally added.
The Kenyan leader attended the coronation, but the proceedings at Buckingham Palace were a royal family affair as explained on the monarch’s website.
PesaCheck has looked into the photo on Twitter purportedly of Kenyan President William Ruto with the royal family at Buckingham Palace and found it to have been ALTERED.
