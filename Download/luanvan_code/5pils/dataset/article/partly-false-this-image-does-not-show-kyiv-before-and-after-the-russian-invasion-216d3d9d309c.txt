This image montage shared on Facebook purporting to show Ukrainian capital Kyiv before and after the Russian invasion is PARTLY FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates “Kyiv, the capital city of Ukraine: before the war began and after the war”.
The post was published on 3 March 2022, a week after Russian forces invaded Ukraine.
Two images accompany the post. The first shows a city with colourful structures, and the second shows a street jammed up with vehicles.
According to the United Nations, there have been “536 civilian casualties across Ukraine, including 136 civilians killed, of whom 13 were children” and mass exodus since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.
It was reported that Russian invading troops captured the city of Kherson, and advanced to the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv on 3 March 2022.
However, the image claiming to show Kyiv city after the Russian invasion is unfounded.
Reverse image search results for the first image show that the picture depicts a street in Kyiv in 2018.
The image was captured by photographer Krblokhin and it shows the street buildings of Kyiv city, on 10 August 2018.
Reverse image search results for the second photo show the situation in Bucha city after the Russian invasion, not Kyiv.
The image was taken by Associated Press (AP) photographer Serhii Nuzhnenko on 1 March 2022 in Bucha city near the capital Kyiv. The image depicts people looking at the destroyed Russian military vehicles on the road in the town of Bucha.
PesaCheck has investigated an image montage shared on Facebook claiming to show Kyiv city before and after the Russian invasion and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
