A tweet with a picture of students purportedly writing their examinations in Butaleja district, Uganda, is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by a text that reads: “Exams in Emmanuel Ddombo’s district.” The tweet refers to a former Bunyole East Member of Parliament, Emmanuel Dombo, who is currently the Director Information and Publicity in the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party. Bunyole East Constituency is in Butaleja District, Uganda.
This publication was posted at a time when the Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) is conducting the Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE) examinations.
Dombo has dismissed claims that the picture was taken in the district.
PesaCheck conducted a reverse image search on TinEye to establish the photograph’s origin and found it was published in 2015 in a blog called Scholars Tanzania.
The photo was also used in 2021 in Nigeria. A keyword search on Google did not yield any results showing students seated on the ground writing their exam in Butaleja, Uganda.
When contacted about the photo through a phone call, UNEB’s Public Relations officer Jennifer Kalule said they have no examination centre in the country where students have to sit on the ground to write their exams.
PesaCheck looked into a picture posted on Twitter claiming to show students doing exams in Butaleja district, Eastern Uganda, and found it to be FALSE.
