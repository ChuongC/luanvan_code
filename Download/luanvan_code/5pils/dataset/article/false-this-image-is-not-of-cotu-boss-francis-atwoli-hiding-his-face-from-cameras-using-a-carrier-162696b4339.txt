A Facebook post with an image attached, and a claim that the subject is Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) boss Francis Atwoli using a carrier bag to hide his face, is FALSE.
“Francis Atwoli Ebs hiding his face from cameras. Mzee tunakujua tu (Old man we know you) [][][],” the post reads.
Atwoli, who supported Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya coalition’s presidential candidate Raila Odinga, has been a subject of interest on Kenyan social media since the declaration of William Ruto as president-elect on 15 August 2022.
The COTU boss has dismissed claims of fleeing the country and resigning from his position at the umbrella labour organisation.
The image in question is unrelated to Atwoli. A Google reverse image search shows that the photo was featured in an article dated 20 March 2019, alongside a series of other photos from the same scene.
The headline reads: “Watajua hawajui (They will know they don’t know)! Suspects who were arrested for 20M fake dollars at Barclays”.
According to the article, the gang, believed to be engaged in the printing of fake currency, was intercepted at the Queensway branch of Barclays Bank by Flying Squad officers.
Another search using the TinEye tool, shows that Kenyan publication Tuko.co.ke ran a similar story.
The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) identified the suspect in question as Mohammed Ijaz Ahmed Shah in a tweet dated 19 March 2019.
“6 People were arrested today evening by @DCI_Kenya Detectives in connection with Fake currency amounting to slightly over 20Million US Dollars,” the tweet reads.
“@Barclays_Kenya~Queensway Branch. The fake notes in 100 Dollar denominations were recovered from the Bank’s Safe Room|@Barclays_Kenya,” the tweet adds.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly showing Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) boss Francis Atwoli hiding his face from cameras using a carrier bag and finds it to be FALSE.
