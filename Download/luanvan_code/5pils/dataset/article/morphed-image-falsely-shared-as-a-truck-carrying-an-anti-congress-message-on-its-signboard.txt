An image of a truck carrying the message ‘डीज़ल पे चलती हूँ, भाड़ा सही लगाऊँगी। सोनिया-राहुल के तरह, दलाली नही खाऊँगी।‘ (which translates to ‘I will go on diesel, I will charge the fare correctly. Not like Sonia and Rahul Gandhi who enjoys the wealth of people by doing brokerage) on its signboard is being shared on social media. Let’s verify the claim made on the post.
Claim: Photo of the truck carrying an anti-Congress message on its signboard.
Fact: The photo shared in the post is an edited one. The original photo shows no text on the back of the truck. The same photo of the truck was earlier shared with a morphed message against PM Narendra Modi and the BJP government. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
 On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar photo of the truck is found in an article published by ‘BIANOTI’ website. In the original photo, there is no text as claimed on the backside of this truck. This original photo also found on a blog. From all these pieces of evidence, it can be concluded that the image shared in the post is a morphed one.
Earlier, a similar image of the truck was shared with a morphed signboard carrying a message against  PM Narendra Modi and the BJP Government. They can be seen here and here. ‘The Times of India’ published a fact-check article on this morphed image of the truck carrying an anti-Modi message.
To sum it up, a morphed image is falsely shared as the truck carrying an anti-Congress message on its signboard.
