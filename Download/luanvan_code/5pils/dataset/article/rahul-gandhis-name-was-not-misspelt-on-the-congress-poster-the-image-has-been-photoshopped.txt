A post with an image of a Congress poster is being shared on Facebook claiming that Rahul Gandhi’s name has been misspelt on the poster. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: A Congress poster in Wayanad (Kerala) misspelt Rahul Gandhi name as ‘Rahul Gandu’.
Fact: The photo of the poster has been taken in Telangana, not Kerala. Also, the photo has been photoshopped. In the actual photo, it can be seen that Rahul Gandhi name has not been misspelt. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
 If the leaders in the poster are clearly observed, it can be found that they are Telangana Congress leaders (Sudheer Reddy at the bottom right and Uttam Kumar at the top right), not Kerala Congress leaders. So, the poster is from Telangana, not Wayanad (Kerala). When the posted picture is run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, a Telugu article published last year on this issue can be found in the search results. So, this image has been in circulation before Rahul filed his nomination in Wayanad. According to that article, the picture was photoshopped to change the name ‘Gandhi’ to ‘Gandu’. The original photo can be found in that article. Also, on the official Facebook account of Sudheer Reddy, a video posted last year shows the same flexi, in which the name was found to be correctly spelt.
To sum it up, Rahul Gandhi’s name was not misspelt on the Congress Poster. The image has been photoshopped.
