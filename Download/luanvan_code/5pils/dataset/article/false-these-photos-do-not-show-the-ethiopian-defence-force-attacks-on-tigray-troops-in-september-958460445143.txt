This Facebook post using these photos purporting to show Ethiopian Defence Force attacks on the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) fighters in September 2022 is FALSE.
The Amharic post translates as; “Breaking News: A group of TPLF broke through the defences on the side of Tekulesh and many of the forces that were about to enter were destroyed and the general was captured. TPLF, who was trying to attack Zobel and Rama, is being defeated by the heroic defence force. Now the group that does not use the peace option will be destroyed for the last time. Victory for the hero defence force who gave himself.”
Fighting between Tigray forces and the Ethiopian Federal Government troops began on 3 November 2020. The two sides reached a cessation of hostilities pact in March 2022, but fighting resumed in August 2022.
On 11 September 2022, the media reported that Tigray forces were willing to abide by immediate cessation of hostilities and take part in a peace process led by the African Union.
However, the photos used to advance the claim are false. Reverse image search results here, here, and here show that the pictures are not related to the 24 August 2022 fighting.
The first image was published on the Negative Colours website on 26 June 2019 in the article titled, “Remembering the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border war.” The original image is also found through searches on TinEye and Yandex.
The second image was published on the Goolgule website on 10 June 2022, in the article, “The bridge that was destroyed by Oromo Liberation Army (Shene) is repaired and started service now.” The article stated that the Ethiopian Defence Force attacked the Oromo Liberation Army in Gujii, Oromia.
The last image was posted on the Disclosure.Ninja website on 6 October 2016, in an article titled, “40 million Russians prepare for disaster or war right now!”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with images claiming to show the Ethiopian Defence Force attacking the Tigray People’s Liberation Front fighters and finds it to be FALSE.
