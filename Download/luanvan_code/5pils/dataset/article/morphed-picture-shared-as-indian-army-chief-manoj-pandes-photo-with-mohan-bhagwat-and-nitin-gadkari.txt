An image is being shared on social media claiming it as Indian Army Chief Manoj Pandey’s picture along with RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. Let’s verify the claim made in the post. 
Claim: Indian Army Chief Manoj Pande’s picture with RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.Fact: The photo shared in the post is a morphed one. This photo was digitally created by adding elements from three different pictures of Mohan Bhagwat, Nitin Gadkari and Indian Army Chief Manoj Pande. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, we found a similar posture of RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat in an image published by the ‘India Today’ on ‘05 December 2016’.  India Today’s image shows Mohan Bhagwat with Shivsena leaders Uddhav and Aditya Thackeray. This photo was shot when Uddhav Thackeray met Mohan Bhagwat to discuss the demonetization move taken by the Narendra Modi Government in 2016.
Nitin Gadkari’s picture in the photo was taken from another photo of his with the MNS Party chief Raj Thackeray. Also, the picture of Indian Army Chief Manoj Pande was taken from another photo. So, it can be confirmed from all these pieces of evidence that the image shared in the post is a morphed picture created by combining three different pictures.
To sum it up, a morphed picture is falsely shared as the picture of Manoj Pande’s picture along with Mohan Bhagwat and Nitin Gadkari.
