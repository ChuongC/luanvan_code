This photo shared on Twitter purportedly of a dilapidated school in Nigeria is FALSE.
The image posted online on 31 January 2023 was accompanied by a text urging Nigerians to vote for the Labour Party (LP) in the upcoming elections for “a better Nigeria”.
Nigerians are expected to vote on 25 February 2023, for among others, a new president to replace President Muhammadu Buhari, whose final term expires in May 2023. The presidential race has attracted 18 candidates.
But, is the photo of a school in Nigeria?
We performed a reverse search on the image and established that it is of a school in Kenya, not Nigeria.
The school is of Mangororo Primary in Kilifi County whose first image surfaced online in May 2019, and different publications, as seen here and here, published the image.
We previously looked into the image and established that the school is in Kilifi County.
Ganze Member of Parliament Teddy Mwambire confirmed to PesaCheck in May 2019 that the school is in his constituency. The MP said the school and several others had been adversely affected by heavy rains.
PesaCheck has examined a photo shared on Twitter purporting to show a dilapidated school in Nigeria and finds it to be FALSE.
