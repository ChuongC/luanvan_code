Many Facebook users are sharing a post with a set of photos cautioning the public not to consume cool drinks as they are contaminated with HTC poison. Let’s try to analyze the claims made in the post.
Claim: Cool drinks were contaminated with HTC poison and their consumption led to the death of people    
Fact: Few of the photos posted are the ones taken when District Food Authority officials raided a fake soft drinks factory in Gujranwala of Pakistan in 2015. Hence, the claim made in the post stands FALSE.    
When the photos in the post are run through Google Reverse Image Search, few of them were found to be taken when District Food Authority officials raided a fake soft drinks factory in Gujranwala of Pakistan in 2015. In 2017, when these photos were circulated with the narration that cool drinks were contaminated with the Ebola virus, Check4spam had written a fact-check article on it.  These images were also circulated as the poisonous drinks in Nigeria, South Africa and other countries.
A video of a bleeding woman is also being circulated, suggesting it as the effect of consuming cool drinks mixed with HTC poison. But the video is from Telangana State wherein a woman was beaten by his husband for questioning him over his extra-marital affair.
To sum it up, photos of the raid on a counterfeit soft drink factory in Pakistan are circulated as public affected due to the consumption of contaminated cool drinks.
