A photo of a large Python caught in a fisherman’s net is being shared on social media claiming it as the photo of a snake found in Hyderabad. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of a large snake found in Hyderabad.
Fact: This photo shows 15-feet-long python trapped in a fisherman’s net in the Krishna river of Andhra Pradesh. This incident took place on ‘08 October 2020’ at Devarapalli village in Andhra Pradesh. This photo has nothing to do with Hyderabad. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search, a similar photo was found in an article published by ‘The Times of India’ news website on ‘9 October 2020’. In the article, it is mentioned that a 15-feet-long python was rescued by Vijayawada forest division officials when it was found trapped in a fisherman’s net in the Krishna river of Andhra Pradesh. This incident took place on ‘8 October 2020’ at Devarapalli village in Andhra Pradesh. It is reported in the article that the Vijayawada forest divisional officers rescued the trapped python from the fisherman’s net and released the snake in the reserve forest area of Kothuru Tadepalli region.
Sharing the same photo, ‘The New Indian Express’ news website also published an article on ‘9 October 2020’. In this article also, it is reported that the incident happened in Devarapalli village of Andhra Pradesh.
To sum it up, photo of a snake trapped in fisherman’s net from Andhra Pradesh is shared as that from Hyderabad city of Telangana.
