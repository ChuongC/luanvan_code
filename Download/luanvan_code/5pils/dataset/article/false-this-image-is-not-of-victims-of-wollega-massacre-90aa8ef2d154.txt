This image on Twitter, allegedly of massacre victims in Wollega, the Oromia region of Ethiopia is FALSE.
The tweet in Amharic translates to; “The government-sponsored ethnic-based massacre in Wollega Oromia should be stopped immediately.”
Attached to the post is an image of a woman, weeping.
However, Google reverse image search results showed that the claim photo is unrelated to the conflict in Wollega.
The image was shared on this website along with other pictures on 23 June 2008 in an article highlighting a food crisis in Ethiopia.
Reuters took the photo and identifies the woman as Amina Nanessa Mohamed, crying on arrival at her home with the body of her four-year-old daughter, Michu, “who died of malnutrition”.
As seen here and here, this image was previously published on other websites.
The war between the Oromo Liberation Army and the Ethiopian Federal government in the Oromia region remains unresolved. Reports such as this and this indicate that drone strikes by government forces killed civilians. The media also reported protests in Oromia after the violence in East Wollega.
PesaCheck has examined a tweet with an image purportedly of massacre victims in Wollega, the Oromia region of Ethiopia, and found it to be FALSE.
