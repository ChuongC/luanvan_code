An image posted online and claiming to show dead animals killed by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces in Dabat Woreda, northern Ethiopia, is FALSE.
The Facebook post, written in Amharic translates, “Don’t tell me that I blamed the year 2013. It was also a bad year for animals. These are the animals killed by the terrorist group in Dabat woreda, North Gondar”.
However, Google reverse image search results show the picture has been on the gettyimages.com website since 2000. The image caption reads; “A group of Ethiopians stand nearby rotten carcasses of animals, 14 April 2000, in Kabridahar, 200 kms northeastern of Gode. Ethiopia will need additional aid to avoid famine resulting from three years of drought, the head of the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said 14 April in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia.

The conflict in northern Ethiopia, pitting national forces against TPLF, has been ongoing since November 2020. The war, initially confined to Tigray, has spread to Amhara and Afar regions. On 5 August 2021, TPLF forces captured Lalibela, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation site in the North Wollo zone of Amhara region. Since then accusations have been traded between the fighting forces amid claims that atrocities are being committed.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show animals killed by TPLF forces in Dabat Woreda and finds it to be FALSE.
