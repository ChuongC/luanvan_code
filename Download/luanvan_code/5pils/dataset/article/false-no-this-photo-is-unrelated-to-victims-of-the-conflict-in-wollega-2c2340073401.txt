This Facebook post with an image claiming to be of Wollega conflict victims in Ethiopia’s Oromia region is FALSE.
“Wollega. #Ethnic_Cleansing,” the post reads.
The same image was shared in a Facebook post with the text: “In the ongoing massacre of innocent citizens of Wollega, the Wollega administration should be held responsible followed by the government of the Oromia region.”
This social media user also shared the photo of victims of the conflict in Wollega.
The war in Oromia continues, and there are reports of deaths and displacement of people in 19 villages of Kiremu district in the Wollega zone. As a result, protests erupted in different parts of the region.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the claimed image is unrelated to the conflict in Wollega.
The image was shared on the Alamy website and it is of a 19-year-old Rohingya refugee and her daughter.
The photo was taken on 8 December 2017 and the image credit is given to Damir Sagolj.
The teenage refugee is one of the more than a million stateless people who fled Myanmar to Bangladesh in 2017 due to religious persecution.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image said to be of victims of the conflict in Wollega, the Oromia region of Ethiopia, and found it to be FALSE.
