A Twitter post with a picture supposedly of ethnic Amhara evicted from Guraferda Town by the Ethiopian government in June 2023 is FALSE.
The claim in Amharic translates to; “Amhara was in trouble then, and today all comes down here, at the heart.”
The image also has an Amharic text that reads: “The Amhara [ethnic] evicted from Guraferda town by order of the government.”
Guraferda is a town in Ethiopia.
Media reports in June 2022 quoted the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) as having reported that more than 200 ethnic Amhara were killed in clashes between federal government troops and Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) in the Oromia region.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the picture in the claim is not of the Amhara evicted from Guraferda.
The Alamy website published the image with the caption, “Thousands of displaced people walk along a road heading north of Goma, in a bid to return to their homes Sunday Nov. 2, 2008 near Kibumba, some 40 kilometers north of Goma in eastern Congo.” The image credit is to Jerome Delay/AP.
