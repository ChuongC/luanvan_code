A photo of Modi and Trump together on a ‘Howdy Modi’ poster is being shared on social media with a claim that it is displayed on a building in New York’s Times Square . Let’s try to analyze the authenticity of this photo.
Claim: Modi and Trump ‘Howdy Mody’ poster at New York’s Times Square.
Fact:  Picture shared as Modi and Trump ‘Howdy Modi’ poster at New York’s Times Square is photoshopped one. The original picture does not have any such poster. Hence the claim is FALSE.  
When the photo in the post was reverse image searched using ‘Yandex’, a photo which looked similar to the photo in the post was obtained in the search result.  Same people and cars were seen in that photo as well. However, there were no posters of ‘Howdy Modi’ in that photo. Also, one building in the photo had a light board with ‘2018’ on it. But ‘Howdy Modi’ event happened in 2019. 
Also, in the search result, ‘PhotoFunia’ website link was one of the results. ‘PhotoFunia’ is a photo effects website. On this website, there is an effect called ‘New York at Night’. By using this effect, we can display photos of our choice on three billboards at Times Square. The photo in the post may have been created in a similar fashion.
To conclude, the picture shared as Modi and Trump ‘Howdy Modi’ poster at New York’s Times Square is photoshopped one. The original picture does not have any such poster. .
