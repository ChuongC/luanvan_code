An image shared on Facebook claiming to show outgoing Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta endorsing Gatundu South Parliamentary contestant is ALTERED.
The image shows Kenyatta holding a document containing a photo of the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party candidate, GG Kagombe. The document also contains UDA’s logo.
“I fully support GG Kagombe MP Gatundu South 2022,” the text on the document reads.
Gatundu South is Kenyatta’s home constituency, and it is where he voted in 2017.
A reverse image search returns different publications containing the image where Kenyatta was not holding a document with text endorsing Kagombe.
For instance, the Council on Foreign Relations published the photo in this article. According to the photo caption, the image is of Kenyatta holding a certificate of president-elect of Kenya after he was announced the winner of the repeat presidential election by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) on 30 October 2017 at the Bomas of Kenya. Thomas Mukoya of Reuters is credited for the photo.
PesaCheck has examined the image claiming to show Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya’s outgoing President, endorsing Gatundu South parliamentary aspirant, and found it to be ALTERED.
