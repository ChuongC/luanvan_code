An image on Facebook claiming to show Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed carrying a sheep on his shoulders is DOCTORED.
The text accompanying the post in Amharic also claims that the excerpts listed in the post are from Abiy’s speeches.
“Since I don’t have time, I will not attain the Nobel Prize program. Lake Haramaya is restored because of the seedlings we have planted. We do not arrest without investigations and we do not look for information after arrests. Even Dubai and Las Vegas do not have such a fountain and flowers,” reads the post in part.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image used to advance the post is doctored.
The original image was published on the Aleteia website on 8 July 2016 in an article, “It’s not always pleasant, following a shepherd”. Similarly, the image was also posted on the Depression Conqueror website on 26 October 2020.
Although Abiy said “We do not arrest without investigations” in one of his speeches and has been criticised for arbitrary and mass arrests, the image used to support the claim is digitally altered.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, carrying a sheep and finds it to be DOCTORED.
