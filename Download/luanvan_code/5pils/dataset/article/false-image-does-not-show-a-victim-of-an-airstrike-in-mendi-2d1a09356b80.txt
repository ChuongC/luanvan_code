A tweet claiming to show a victim of an airstrike in Mendi, the Oromia region of Ethiopia, is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by a tweet that says, “More airstrikes kill dozens in Mendi, West Wollega — Mounting civilian casualties draw…”
A link attached to the post directs to this website. The same image is found on the website and is captioned: “An injured protester waits for help after several people died during the Irreechaa, the thanksgiving festival of the Oromo people in Bishoftu town of Oromia region.” Image credit is given to Tiksa Negeri/Reuters Media Express.
Although it is stated on the website that it is a file photo and the context of the image is given, it will mislead people who only see the tweet and don’t click on the link.
In addition, Google reverse image search results showed that the claim image was shared on other websites. For instance, the image was published on this website.
The photo was also used on the Aljazeera website as a thumbnail image in the anti-government protests that grew out of the Irrecha festival in Bishoftu in 2016.
News reports say due to airstrikes by the Federal Government of Ethiopia, dozens of civilians died on 9 November 2022 in Mendi, West Wollega. The war between the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) and the Federal Government of Ethiopia is yet to be resolved.
PesaCheck has examined the tweet with an image claiming to show a victim of an airstrike in Mendi, the Oromia region of Ethiopia, and found it to be FALSE.
