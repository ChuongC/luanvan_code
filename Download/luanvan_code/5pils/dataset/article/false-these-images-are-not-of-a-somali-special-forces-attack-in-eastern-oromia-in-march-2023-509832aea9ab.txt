This tweet with images purportedly of an attack in eastern Oromia by the Somali Special Forces in March 2023 is FALSE.
The accompanying text reads: “The border fighting continues in Eastern Oromia. The Somali Special Police launched an attack on the civilians in the recently named Makkaniisa District of Jarso in Eastern Oromia displaced people from seven villages and destroyed public property by fire.”
However, Google reverse image search results, as seen here and here, show that the photos are not of the Somali Special Forces attacking eastern Oromia in March 2023.
The first image was published on the Mako website on 5 December 2021, in an article in Hebrew headed, “Fire in a fuel tank in Ashkelon — residents of the area are asked to stay in their homes.”
The second image was published on The Dhacdo website on 24 July 2022 in an article with the headline, “Al-Shabab Fighters ‘Destroyed’ in Ethiopian Incursion, Somali State Media Reports.”
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image purportedly of an attack in Eastern Oromia by the Somali Special Forces in March 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
