An image of a billboard shared on Twitter claiming to show Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya presidential candidate Raila Odinga dozing is ALTERED.
The billboard is captioned ‘Retirement is Here’.
The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission cleared Odinga to vie for president in Kenya’s 9 August 2022 general elections. Odinga is among the four candidates and he is considered one of the frontrunners.
The other three are William Ruto of Kenya Kwanza, George Wajackoyah (Roots Party) and David Waihiga (Agano Party).
The accompanying write-up in the billboard reads; “It’s time for the final blow, Aendee achunge Mbuzi Bondo Sasa (he should now go and tend goats in Bondo) ..RUTO THE 5TH.”
We did a reverse image search of the billboard and established that the image is doctored.
The original image was by Pina Colada Lounge, Nakuru, advertising an event dubbed ‘Turn Up Sato’ on 18 June 2022.
The event was to be graced by DJ Genius Jay. At the bottom of the billboard, Kenyans were reminded that excessive consumption of alcohol is harmful to their health and advised not to share the event details with minors.
PesaCheck has examined an image of a billboard shared on Twitter claiming to show Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya presidential candidate Raila Odinga dozing and finds it to be ALTERED.
