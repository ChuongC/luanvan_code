A post accompanying an image of a little girl holding a basket of rotis is being widely shared across social media platforms associating the image to the ongoing farmers’ protest. Through this article let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Little girl serving rotis to protesting farmers.
Fact: The image is available on the internet since 2017. The image has nothing to do with the ongoing farmers’ protest. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
Reverse image search of the photo in the post led us to a 2017 Facebook post which shared the same image. The location pinned with this post is of Paonta Sahib, which is a town in Himachal Pradesh.
Though we could not independently verify the original source and location of the image, the presence of the image on the internet dating back to 2017 establishes the fact that this image has nothing to do with the ongoing farmers’ protest.
In the light of the ongoing farmers’ protests against the new farm legislation, posts like these are being shared across social media with misleading claims.
To sum it up, at least three years old image is being shared as a little girl serving rotis to farmers protesting against the recently launched farm legislation.
