This Facebook post with an image allegedly showing the state at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) on 9 November 2023 is FALSE.
“JKIA today…looking like Gikomba market,” reads the text accompanying the image.
The post showcases an image of a room with a stack of luggage.
The image went viral, triggered by outrage by Kenyans accusing Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) officials of harassing travellers at JKIA. The controversy stems from KRA’s directive to tax personal or household items valued at $500 and above, irking the public.
But was this image taken at JKIA? We checked.
After conducting a reverse image search, we found that the picture was initially posted on a stock photography website named DreamsTime by Oleg Marushin. The image’s caption indicates that it was generated using Generative AI, an “artificial intelligence technology for creating various content types, including text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data”.
The goal of the creator of the image was to show “The Challenges of Airport Luggage and the Suitcase Hassle.”
The image was also shared on Instagram by a person named “debbie.i.schneider” on 28 August 2023, before KRA’s crackdown at the JKIA.
We also checked whether the image was AI-generated by running it through an AI software dubbed “Hive Moderation”, which concluded that there is a 99.9 per cent likelihood that it was created using AI.
“Content at Scale” and “Is It AI” detected a 61 per cent and 52.46 per cent likelihood of AI in the image, respectively.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image allegedly depicting the state at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) on 9 November 2023 and found it to be FALSE.
