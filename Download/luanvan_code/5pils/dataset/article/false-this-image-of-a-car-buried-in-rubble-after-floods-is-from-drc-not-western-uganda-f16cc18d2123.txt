A Facebook post claiming that an embedded image of a man standing on top of a car buried in the rubble was taken in Uganda is FALSE.
The post claims the photo was taken after a heavy downpour in southwestern Uganda.
The same photo of the man standing on top of the car buried in rubble has been shared and claimed to be taken from Rift Valley in Kenya as well.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the photo was taken in Uvira city in South Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) after Nyarumanga River broke its banks, leading to heavy floods in the region.
It was first published in an article by ActuRDC on April 29, after flooding affected the city of Uvira in the South Kivu Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The western region of Uganda has also experienced heavy floods after a heavy downpour pounded the sub-counties of Kabuyanda, Mwizi and Birere in Isingiro district, leaving at least four people dead and 5,000 displaced.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming that the image of a man standing on top of a car buried in rubble was taken in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
