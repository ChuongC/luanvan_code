A Facebook post claiming that a photo of a crowd surrounding a street fire was taken in Kasese district, Uganda is FALSE.
The post claims the people of Kasese have started demanding for the win of Mr Kyangulanyi Sentamu Robert, suggesting the photo was taken in Kasese amid protests over the election results and demands that Robert Kyagulanyi be declared winner.
On January 14, parliamentary and presidential elections were held in Uganda and incumbent President Yoweri Museveni was declared winner after a contest with opposition front runner, Mr Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine.
The period leading up to and following the tense polls were characterised by an internet shutdown and military deployment as the government moved to avert possible violence.
Mr Kyagulanyi and his supporters have since expressed dissatisfaction with the election outcome.
However, a Google reverse search reveals that the photo was taken in the coastal city of Mombasa, Kenya, in October 2017 and not in Uganda.
The photo was taken during a protest against an election re-run, after the Kenyan Supreme court took the unprecedented move to annul the August 2017 presidential poll outcome and ordered for fresh elections in October the same year.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim of a photo allegedly taken in Uganda as protesters demanded that opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi is declared winner of the 2021 presidential elections, and finds it to be FALSE.
