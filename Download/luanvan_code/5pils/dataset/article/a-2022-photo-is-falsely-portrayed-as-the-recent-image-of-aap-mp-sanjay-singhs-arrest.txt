A photo of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh being lifted by his limbs by the police is being shared on social media, claiming that it was taken when the Enforcement Directorate arrested him on 4 October 2023 in relation to the Delhi Excise policy case. Letâ€™s fact-check this claim through this article.
Claim: Photo of AAP MP Sanjay Singh taken away by police after his arrest on 4 October 2023.
Fact: This photo was taken in October 2022 when Sanjay Singh was detained for protesting outside the Central Bureau of Investigation(CBI) headquarters in Delhi against CBI questioning the then Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, Manish Sisodia. Hence, the claim made in the post is Misleading.
A reverse image search on the photo on Google led us to a few news articles (here, here, and here), which revealed this photo to be old and from 2022.
Reportedly, on 17 October 2022, when the then Deputy CM of Delhi, Manish Sisodia, was getting questioned by the CBI in relation to the Delhi Excise policy scam, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh took part in a protest. The police detained him for allegedly violating prohibitory orders. The viral photo was taken on that day.
