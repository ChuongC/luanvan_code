An image shared on Facebook claiming to show a bird’s-eye view of the Thika superhighway in Nairobi, Kenya is FALSE.
The image shows interconnected infrastructure, including a multilane highway and railway near an urbanised settlement.
The aerial shot is accompanied by a post that suggests that President Uhuru Kenyatta has delivered on his promise.
Launched in November 2012, by former President Mwai Kibaki, the Nairobi-Thika superhighway is a 50-kilometre construction between downtown Nairobi and Thika town, northeast of the capital. President Kenyatta was the Minister of Finance under Kibaki’s administration.
The highway links the main commercial centres of Isiolo, Marsabit, Moyale and Mandera to Nairobi, and is part of the Trans — Africa Highway running from Cape Town to Cairo.
However, a reverse image search reveals that the photo does not show any part of Thika superhighway.
Among the search results is an article by EarthWonders listing impressive infrastructure from across the world. The article contains the image and identifies the infrastructure network to be located in Breda, in the southern part of The Netherlands. The project combines an ecoduct — a wildlife crossing bridge — railways, highways, roads and walkways.
Other articles published on websites such as listal.com, boredpanda.com, and laptrinhx.com corroborate this evidence.
PesaCheck has looked into the image claiming to show an aerial shot of the Thika superhighway in Nairobi, Kenya, and finds it to be FALSE.
