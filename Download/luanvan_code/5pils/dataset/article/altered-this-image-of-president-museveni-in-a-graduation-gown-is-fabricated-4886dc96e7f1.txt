A Facebook post with an image of Ugandan President dressed in a graduation gown is ALTERED.
The image, which claims to show a young Yoweri Museveni clad in a graduation gown, was purportedly taken on his graduation day in 1969.
The photo emerged after Betty Nambooze, a Ugandan member of parliament, promised UGX 10 million to anyone with a picture of Museveni in a graduation gown.
She threw down the challenge when she appeared on a local television show.
The photo has been shared multiple times online here, here and here.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the picture was edited to include the face of Museveni.
The original image shows a graduate in graduation attire standing in front of a pull-up banner with the branding of the University of Dar es Salaam.
The original image was taken in November 2018 during the 48th graduation ceremony and shared on the University’s Facebook page.
The distinguishable features of the image with Museveni’s face were doctored.
The colours of the image have also been changed to make it appear old.
Additionally, while the post claims that the photo was taken in 1969 during Museveni’s graduation, the University of East Africa at Dar es Salaam website shows that he enrolled in 1967 and graduated in 1970 with a BA (honours) in political science and economics.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image of Uganda’s President Museveni dressed in a graduation gown and finds that it was ALTERED.
