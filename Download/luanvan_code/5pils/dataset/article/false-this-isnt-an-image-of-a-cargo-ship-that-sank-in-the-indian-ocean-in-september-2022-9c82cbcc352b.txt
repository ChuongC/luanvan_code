This Facebook post with an image claiming to show a cargo ship sinking in the Indian Ocean in September 2022 is FALSE.
The post in Afaan Oromo shared on 13 September 2022 reads in part: “A traders ship heading via Puntland to Bosaso port was sunk in the Indian Ocean.”
“The cargo ship known as Al-Yasin was carrying about 1200 tonnes of goods when it had left the United Arab Emirates, Dubai. This was the 4th ship that sank in the year 2022”.
The post is accompanied by an image of a ship swaying in the ocean.
Puntland is an arid region in northeast Somalia, which declared itself an autonomous state in August 1998. Bosaso port is a medium-sized fishing port in Somalia, located in the south part of the Gulf of Aden, on the northeast coast of Somalia.
Vessel Finder, an online vessel tracking service provider, indicates that the Al Yasin is a cargo ship and is currently sailing under the flag of Somalia.
However, there is no online report related to the sinking of the Al Yasin in the Indian Ocean in September 2022 as claimed by the post.
Moreover, the attached image does not show the Al Yasin sinking in the Indian Ocean in September 2022.
Google reverse image search results established that the image is of a Norwegian cargo ship on the west coast of Norway.
The image was published by the European Pressphoto Agency (EPA), in March 2019 and it shows the Norwegian cargo vessel named Hagland Captain, which faced engine problems off the west coast of Norway on 24 March 2019.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a cargo ship sinking in the Indian Ocean in September 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
