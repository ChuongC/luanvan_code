A photo of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in a saree and ringing a temple bell is being shared widely on social media with a claim that it shows Priyanka wearing Indira Gandhi’s saree as Bihar Assembly elections – 2020 are coming up. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wearing Indira’s saree as Bihar Assembly elections – 2020 are coming up.Fact: The photo was taken in 2009 in Amethi (UP). It is not related to the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections – 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the image was run through the Google Reverse Image, only recent posts with the same claim were found in the search results. But, when we searched with the keywords taken from the claim, many similar posts with the same photo were found to be posted in October 2018. So, it can be concluded that this image is not related to the upcoming Bihar elections – 2020.
When we searched with other keywords and using time filter, the same photo was found to be uploaded by ‘Pressbrief .in’ on the Flickr website. In the description, it can be read that the photo was taken on 12 April 2009 when Priyanka Gandhi visited a ‘Durga temple during the election campaign for her brother Rahul Gandhi in Amethi’. Other similar photos can be found here.
Also, the photos related to her visit to the temple in 2009 can be found on the ‘Getty Images’ and ‘Outlook’ websites. We could not find any information about her saree.  
While the posted photo is old, Priyanka Gandhi recently visited Delhi’s Valmiki Temple to attend a prayer meeting for Hathras victim. The news articles regarding her visit to the temple can be read here and here.
To sum it up, a photo from 2009 falsely shared as ‘Priyanka wearing Indira’s saree as Bihar Assembly elections – 2020 are coming up’.
