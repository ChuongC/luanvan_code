A post is being shared on social media claiming that posters featuring Indian Cricket Team Captain Rohit Sharma were exhibited in India’s new Parliament and at the G20 summit as a representation of the country’s sporting achievements. A photo showing Rohit Sharma’s framed photograph hung on a wall was shared in the post. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Rohit Sharma’s poster displayed in India’s new parliament and at the G20 summit.
Fact: The photo shared in the post is an edited one. The original photo frame exhibited at the Chepauk Stadium Museum featured a still of Sunil Gavaskar and Krishnamachari Srikkanth. There are no reports of Rohit Sharma’s posters being displayed in India’s new parliament or at the G20 summit as a representation of the country’s sporting achievements. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, we found a few social media users sharing the same photo by stating that the photo frame was displayed in the Chepauk Museum in Chennai. When we searched for further sources, we found a similar photo tweeted by an ‘X’ user with the description, “Chepauk museum featuring MS Dhoni, Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev.” However, the image shared by this user did not show Rohit Sharma’s photo frame being displayed on that same wall.
On searching for further details, we found a video tweeted by the BCCI, showing the visuals from the museum and dressing room inside the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, commonly known as Chepauk Stadium, in Chennai. The original photo frame exhibited at the Chepauk Stadium Museum featured a still of Sunil Gavaskar and Krishnamachari Srikkanth.

A video published by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin’s official YouTube channel, related to the inauguration of a pavilion stand at Chepauk stadium, also showed the photo frames of Kapil Dev, M. S. Dhoni, and Sunil Gavaskar inside the Chepauk Museum. No photo frame featuring Rohit Sharma was exhibited at the museum in the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium.
Many social media users shared similar edited images of Virat Kohli’s photo adjusted on the same photo frame of Sunil Gavaskar and Krishnamachari Srikkanth. There are no reports of Rohit Sharma’s posters being displayed in India’s new parliament or at the G20 summit as a representation of the country’s sporting achievements. India TV also published a fact-check article confirming that the viral photo is edited and that no poster of Rohit Sharma was displayed in Parliament or Bharat Mandapam
To sum it up, an edited image is shared as the poster of Rohit Sharma showcased at India’s new Parliament and at the G20 summit as a representation of the country’s sporting achievements.
