A Facebook post with an image claiming to show Sudanese militants invading southwestern Ethiopia is FALSE.
The post in Afaan Oromo translates into; “It is reported that the Sudanese militants have invaded 150 kilometers of southwestern Ethiopia.”
On 26 June 2022, the Ethiopian Reporter reported that “South Sudanese militants have reportedly taken control of a gold mine in Southwestern Ethiopia.”
But the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation reported that South Sudan’s Armed Forces have not invaded the Southwestern Ethiopian People’s Region.
Nevertheless, the photo used to advance the claim is false. Google’s reverse image search shows that the picture is not connected to Ethiopia.
The image was published by the Humanitarian Law and Policy website on 11 October 2016 in the article, “The establishment of courts by armed groups: what is the legal basis?”
The image caption indicates the photo was released in 2008, and shows “soldiers of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SPLA) in 2008.” The image is credited to UN Photo/ Tim Mckulka.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show the Sudanese militants have invaded 150 kilometres of Southwestern Ethiopia and finds it to be FALSE.
