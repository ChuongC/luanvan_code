A Facebook post with an image that it claims shows Ugandan military and police attacking Bobi Wine’s office in Kamwokya on January 18, is FALSE.
The post, which was shared on January 18, 2021, has an image of law enforcement officers standing next to a building.
A Google reverse image search shows that the image does not depict recent events as claimed in the post. The image, showing a police cordon, was first shared in October 2020 when police officers sealed off roads leading to offices of Mr Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine.
The same image has featured in multiple stories, here and here, and has been accompanied by reports that Ugandan security forces detained Bobi Wine during a raid of the campaign headquarters in October 2020.
This claim follows the January 16 declaration by the Electoral Commission of Uganda that long-serving President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni had won another five-year term in office.
On Monday, January 18, the leader of Uganda’s main opposition party, Bobi Wine tweeted that heavily armed military and police had once again raided their party offices in Kampala.
However, PesaCheck has looked into this Facebook post claiming to show an image of the Uganda military and police raiding Bobi Wine’s office in Kamwokya on Monday 18, and finds it to be FALSE.
