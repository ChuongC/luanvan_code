A tweeted image that shows a burnt double cabin pickup truck alongside a claim that it was set on fire by supporters of Bobi Wine and the National Unity Platform (NUP) party is FALSE.
According to the tweet, supporters of the National Unity Platform party led by presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine, are burning peopleâ€™s property in the disguise of protesting and condemns the actions.
The hashtag #StopHooliganism is quoted in the tweet that has been shared multiple times.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image in the tweet was first shared in 2018 and is associated with events in Yumbe District.
The image shows the aftermath of angry demonstrations against an operation launched by the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) to hunt unregistered motorcycles in the region, leaving the vehicle torched.
Additionally, multiple local blogs such as PML Daily, Radio Pacis and Chimpreports also featured the same image as that in the tweet.
At the time of the incident, Bobi Wine had not assumed leadership of the National Unity Platform (NUP) party, formerly known as the National Unity, Reconciliation and Development Party which was led by Moses Nkonge Kibalama.
On July 14, Mr Kyagulanyi assumed leadership of the party and was declared the party flag-bearer for the February 2021 Ugandan presidential elections.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweeted image claiming to show a burnt double cabin pickup truck with a claim that it was burnt by supporters of Bobi Wine and the National Unity Platform (NUP) party and finds it to be FALSE.
