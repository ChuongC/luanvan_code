On Facebook, a few users are posting a picture of Muslims burning an Indian flag and are alleging that the incident happened in India. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: In the picture, Muslims burning the Indian flag are Indians and the incident happened in India.
Fact: This is a 2015 photo taken when Pakistani protesters burnt an Indian flag during a protest in Multan. Hence, the claim that the Muslims burning the tricolor flag are Indians stands FALSE.  
When the photo in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search technique with a filter “Indian flag burnt”, it was found in a blog with the title “Pakistani protesters burn a poster of PM Narendra Modi”. In the blog, the photo credits to this image are given to “AP Photo”. If the official website of Associated Press (AP) Photos is searched, this particular photo can be seen. From the description given about the photo, it was known that on June 11, 2015, Pakistani protesters have burnt an Indian flag during a protest in Multan. They have done it in response to the comments made by Indian Prime Minister Modi, who acknowledged that Indian forces had a role in the war that created Bangladesh, which was part of Pakistan until 1971 when separatists won independence after a war.
To conclude, the Muslims burning the Indian flag aren’t Indians and the incident is not from India.
