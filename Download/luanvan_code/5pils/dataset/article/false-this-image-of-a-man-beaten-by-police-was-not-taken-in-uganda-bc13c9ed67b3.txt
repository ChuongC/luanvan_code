A tweet claiming to show a man beaten by security operatives in Uganda is FALSE.
The author alleges the beating victim is one of the many victims of police brutality in Mubende and Kassanda districts, where security operatives have also impounded “over 1,000 motorcycles”. One has to pay between USh200,000 and USh300,000 to recover the bikes, the tweet claims.
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni imposed a 21-day lockdown on Mubende and Kassanda to contain the spread of Ebola.
The image was also shared here, with a claim that it was captured in Uganda.
However, a Google reverse image search on the photo shows that it was not taken in Uganda. Instead, the picture was taken in Tshwane, a metropolitan municipality in South Africa, in October 2021.
According to the DailyNewsSA, the incident happened on 2 October 2021, and three men were allegedly sjambokked by eight metro police officials at the Tshwane Impound Vehicle Centre, where they had gone to collect their car.
Local media report that residents of Kassanda District have been complaining of the brutal force used by security operatives, particularly police officers, during the enforcement of the Ebola lockdown guidelines.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet claiming to show a man who was beaten by security operatives while impounding motorcycles in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
