An internet search shows that the photos were taken in Taiwan and Haiti.
A tweet with photos claiming to show violence in Uganda is FALSE.
The tweet, shared on January 14, 2021, contains two combined images; the first one shows police charging while aiming their guns and the second shows young boys running.
The post accompanying the photos states that there is a silent genocide going on in Uganda and that people are bleeding.
The post adds that 10 people in Mbale Tirinyi have been shot dead by police for expressing their concern about ballot paper fraud.
However, a Google reverse image search of the first image brings up several articles published alongside it. One of the articles, published by Foreign Policy (FP) News in September 2018, credits the image to Getty Images/AFP photographer Many Cheng. The caption reads, “Taiwanese soldiers simulate fending off an attempted invasion during an annual drill at the military base in Hualien on Jan. 30.”
An internet search on the second image reveals that it was uploaded on the internet as early as 2011 and was taken in Haiti. In an article published on ABC.net.au the caption on the image reads, “Children running away from a helicopter delivering aid in Haiti after an earthquake.”
PesaCheck has looked into the tweet with photos claiming to show violence in Uganda, and finds it to be FALSE.
