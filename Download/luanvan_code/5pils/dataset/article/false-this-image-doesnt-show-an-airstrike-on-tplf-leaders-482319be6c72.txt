A Facebook post with an image claiming to be of an airstrike on the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) at Abiy Addi is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by Afaan Oromo text that translates to; “ Special information: Today, an attack was carried out at the place where the leaders of the TPLF were encamped in Abiy Addi. The action that has been started should be continued.”
However, Google reverse image search results established that the image is unrelated to the war in northern Ethiopia.
According to the search results, Defence Web published the photo on 12 March 2020, in an article headlined: “Tunisia orders Anka-S UAVs from Turkey.” The photo description is: “A TAI Anka UAV.”
The image was also published on the Hurriyet Daily News website on 27 August 2013, in the article headed: “Turkish UAV market may boom after development.”
On 2 November 2022, the Ethiopian Federal Government and Tigray forces agreed to end the two-year conflict, which broke out in the Tigray region in November 2020.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of an airstrike on the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) at Abiy Addi and finds it to be FALSE.
