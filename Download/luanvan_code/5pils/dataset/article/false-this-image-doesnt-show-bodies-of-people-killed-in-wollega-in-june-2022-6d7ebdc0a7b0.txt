This Facebook post with an image claiming to show bodies of people killed in Wollega in June 2022 is FALSE.
“If you continue laughing at the death of our people, it will be a matter of time before it knocks on your door. The number of people killed in West Wollega has reached 500. Excluding the abducted …!” the post in Amharic states.
To advance the claim, an image that shows a mass grave with bodies laid in it and mourners surrounding it is attached to the post.
On 20 June 2022, as seen here and here, it was reported that more than 200 civilians were killed in the West Wollega Zone of Oromia. A report by Relief Web indicates local witnesses stated the number of casualties as somewhere between 260 and 320.
However, a reverse image search using Google reveals that the picture has previously been used to support an unrelated story.
The photo was shared on the African News Channel website on 11 March 2022 to support an article titled, “Violations Of Human Rights In Afar And Amhara Regions Of Ethiopia.” The image description states, “mass grave Amhara”.
This article discusses the human rights violations in relation to the war in the northern parts of Ethiopia, which began in November 2020. Yet, currently, the conflicting parties have reached an agreement on the cessation of hostility.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with an image claiming to show bodies of people killed in Wollega in June 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
