These images of a woman nursing a baby in what looks like an alleyway were not taken in Kenya, as claimed in this Twitter post.
The images show a woman wrapped in a multi-coloured sarong sitting beside an infant swaddled in cloth, in what appears to be a littered alleyway.
The text above the images reads, “It pains me a lot when I see Kenyans live this way”.
However, a reverse image search shows both photos first appeared online on 5 December 2020, when Facebook users in Nigeria began sharing them in different posts as seen here, here and here.
The Nigerian Facebook users claimed the lady had given birth to a bouncing baby. The mother lives in Ondo state, South-West Nigeria, according to this post.
PesaCheck has looked into images shared on Twitter showing a woman nursing an infant in what appears to be an alley and claiming they were taken in Kenya and finds it to be FALSE.
