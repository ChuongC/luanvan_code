This photo on Facebook, supposedly of Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga being crowned a Nigerian elder, is ALTERED.
The image is of Odinga dressed in white and seated on a throne.
“Former PM RailaOdinga has this evening been crowned as a special Osun-Osogbo elder at an invite-only ceremony held at a “sacred grove” along the banks of Osun River, Osogbo City, Nigeria. Weh! Babaman supporters get ready for BBI 2!” the post dated 2 September 2023 reads.
But, is the image authentic?
Google reverse image search established that the original image is of Jean-Bedel Bokassa, the self-proclaimed emperor of the Central African Empire.
According to Getty Images, the photo was taken on 4 December 1977 after Bokassa crowned himself in Bangui, the Central African Republic capital. The photo library credited the image to a contributor named Pierre Guillaud.
The photo was also published here, here, and here.
A Google search did not yield credible results for Odinga being crowned a Nigerian elder. Pulse Live and Kenyans.co.ke also debunked the image and found it to be doctored.
On 2 September 2023, when the claim was made, Odinga was attending a funeral in Vihiga County, Kenya.
PesaCheck examined a photo on Facebook, supposedly of Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga being crowned a Nigerian elder, and found it to be ALTERED.
