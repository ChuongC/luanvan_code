A social media post which claims to show an image of P. Chidambaram, touching the feet of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa is being widely shared. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image showing P. Chidambaram touching the feet of Jayalalithaa.
Fact: The person touching the feet of Jayalalithaa in the viral image is former Tamil Nadu minister Thambi Durai, not P. Chidambaram. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
The viral image indeed shows a man touching the feet of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. However, it is not P. Chidambaram, as claimed in the post.
Reverse image search of the viral photo led us to a blog titled “Tamil Nadu ministers falling at Jayalalitha’s feet”. This blog, dated 13 September 2005, sharing the images, takes a jibe at ministers for touching the feet of Jayalalithaa.
The viral image is also featured in this collection, however, as per this blog, the man seen touching the feet of Jayalalithaa is not P. Chidambaram but former Tamil Nadu minister Thambi Durai.
Thambi Durai was the Minister for Education, in AIADMK’s government, during the 2001-05 period (here & here).  Further, we could not find any information about P. Chidambaram falling at the feet of Jayalalithaa.
To sum it up, this image doesn’t show P. Chidambaram touching Jayalalithaa’s feet.
