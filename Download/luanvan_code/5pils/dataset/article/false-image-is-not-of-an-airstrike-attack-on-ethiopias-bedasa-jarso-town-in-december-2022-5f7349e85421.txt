A Facebook post claiming to show an airstrike on Ethiopia’s Bedasa Jarso town in December 2022 is FALSE.
Attached to the post is a photo of a jet and an Afaan Oromo text translated as; “An air attack is being carried out in Bedasa Jarso Kebele Sasiga district, East Wollega zone.”
Bedasa Jarso town is in East Wollega, Oromia region.
Addis Standard reports that on 9 November 2022, Ethiopian government airstrikes killed dozens of civilians in Mendi and West Wollega, Oromia region.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the picture is not of the purported attack on Bedasa Jarso.
The Wikimedia Commons website published the image on 25 December 2014 with the caption, “UAV with serial number A041–65, operated by the Iranian Army Ground Force’s Vali-e Asr Drone Group, shortly after taking off at Iran’s Muhammad Rasullullah wargames exercise in Jask port, southern Iran.” The image is credited to Mahdi Marizad of Fars News.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show an airstrike against Bedasa Jarso town in December 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
