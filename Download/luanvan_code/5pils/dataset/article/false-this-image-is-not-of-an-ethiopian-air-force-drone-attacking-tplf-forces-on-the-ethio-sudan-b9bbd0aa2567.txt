A Facebook post with an image claiming to show an Ethiopian Air Force drone attacking the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) forces on the Ethio-Sudan border is FALSE.
The Facebook post has a picture of a drone and an Amharic text that translates, “Breaking: Sudan residing TPLF team called ‘Samri’ attacked by Ethiopian drones on the border of Ethiopia while they are preparing to disrupt the Great Renaissance Dam of Ethiopia by receiving missions from Egypt and Sudan.”
In May 2021, there were reports that the Ethiopian army killed a large group of fighters attempting to enter the country from neighbouring Sudan. The fighters were said to be members of the former ruling party of the Tigray region.
However, reverse image search results on Yandex reveal that the photo used in the post has nothing to do with the conflict in Ethiopia.
The image was captured from a video initially published by the Bunker 27 website titled, “THE 62ND EXPEDITIONARY ATTACK SQUADRON AT KANDAHAR AIRFIELD.” The video description on YouTube indicates it was captured on 16 January 2019, by Senior Airman Jean-Paul Arnaud-Marquez.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show an Ethiopian Air Force drone attacking TPLF forces on the Ethio-Sudan border and finds it to be FALSE.
