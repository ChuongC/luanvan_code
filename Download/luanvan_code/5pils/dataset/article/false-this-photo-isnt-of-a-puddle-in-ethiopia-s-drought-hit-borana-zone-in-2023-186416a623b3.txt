A Facebook post with an image supposedly of a puddle in Ethiopia’s drought-affected Borana zone in 2023 is FALSE.
The photo is accompanied by a text in Amharic, loosely translated as; “I know that you can do all things, no purpose of yours can be thwarted. We thank God for everything. Job 42:2 It rained in Borena!”
A loose translation of a similar post in Amharic is: “Borena got rain after five years. Thank you, God. You are not inconsistent. Your work is wonderful. Congratulations.”
Another social media user attached a similar photo of a puddle.
The Borana, also spelt as Borena, is in Oromia, a region facing severe drought like most others in the Horn of Africa. It is estimated that more than 3.3 million livestock have died due to the drought. The region is in its fifth consecutive season of no rain.
An estimated 150,000 Boranas have joined 20 camps designated for internally displaced persons due to drought, conflict and other natural and man-made disasters.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo in the claim is old, having been shared on the BBC website in 2022. As such, the image is not of the current situation in Borana.
PesaCheck has examined a Facebook post with an image supposedly of a puddle in the drought-affected Borana zone in 2023 and found it to be FALSE.
