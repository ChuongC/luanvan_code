This tweet with a photo supposedly of a decrepit road in Kisigula, Kampala, Uganda, is FALSE.
The photo features a road destroyed by erosion, creating what appears to be huge trenches.
“My friends from kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania.. this is not a continental drift; it is a public highway in Kisigula main street in Kampala downtown (sic),” the tweet reads.
To verify the photo’s authenticity, we performed a Google reverse image search and established that the road is in Nigeria, not Uganda.
An article published by News Extra 24 on 30 June 2020 identified the photo to be of Gafaru Street in Ikotun, Alimosho local government, Lagos State, Nigeria.
