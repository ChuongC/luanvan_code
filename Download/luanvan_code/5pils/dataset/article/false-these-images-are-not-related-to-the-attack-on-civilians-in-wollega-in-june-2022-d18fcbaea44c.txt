This Facebook post with images claiming to show an attack on civilians in Wollega, the Oromia region of Ethiopia in June 2022, is FALSE.
The post in the Amharic text translates into; “Can you see? These are Amharas. They fall like this in Wollega without having someone to bury them. #StopAmharaGenocide #AmharaGenocide #welegamassacre #Let’s live # Don’t kill us #no more”
Two images accompany the post.
But as seen here and here, results from Google reverse image search shows that the claimed photos have no relation to the recent attack on civilians in West Wollega in June 2022.
The first image was shared on this Twitter account on 15 March 2022. The tweet stated, “It breaks my heart to see this. Bale needs humanitarian assistance before the situation there gets any worse.”
The second image was posted on this Twitter account along with other images on 15 June 2021.
The caption of the image reads; “No-one should trust the genocidal gov’t of Col.Abiy. As usual, they will deny everything or they will promise you that everything is improving. #UNSC act now. Please stop #TigrayGenocide #EthnicCleansing #WeaponizedMassStarvation.”
Media reports say more than 200 civilians have died in the fighting between government forces and Oromo Liberation Army. After the latest incident, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission called on the government to protect civilians and find a solution to the problem.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with images claiming to show an attack on civilians in Wollega, the Oromia region of Ethiopia in June 2022, and finds it to be FALSE.
