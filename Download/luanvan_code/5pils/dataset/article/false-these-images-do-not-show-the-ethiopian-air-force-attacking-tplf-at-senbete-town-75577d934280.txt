These images shared on Facebook claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attacking Tigray forces at Senbete town are FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates, “Ethiopian Air Force has taken action and bombarded the Junta’s Army at Senbete town”.
Senbete town is located in Ethiopia’s Amhara regional state.
In November 2020, the Ethiopian government launched military operations against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in the Tigray region. The conflict has since spilt into neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions.
However, Google reverse image search results, here and here, show that the pictures have previously been published online and are not connected to the conflict in Tigray.
The first image was used by the FB website on 10 April 2016, to illustrate an article about transport and assault helicopter Mi-8AMTSh. It is also found in its original format here and is credited to the Press Service of the Eastern Military District of the Russian army.
The second image was published on The Guardian website on 26 March 2020. The image caption reads, “A Typhoon from RAF Lossiemouth intercepts a Russian Tu-142 ‘Bear’ bomber as it approaches UK airspace in a Ministry of Defence photograph issued on 11 March. Photograph: MoD Crown Copyright/PA”.
PesaCheck has looked into Facebook images claiming to show the Ethiopian Air Force attacking the Tigray army at Senbete town and finds them to be FALSE.
