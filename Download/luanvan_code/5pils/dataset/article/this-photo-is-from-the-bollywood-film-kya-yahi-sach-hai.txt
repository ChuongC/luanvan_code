A photo is being shared on social media claiming that IAS and IPS officers of the country are kneeling like this in front of the political leaders in India. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of IPS officers kneeling in front of a political leader in India.
Fact: Photo in the post shows a still from a Bollywood film ‘Kya Yahi Sach Hai’. This film is based on the effect of fast deteriorating ethics in police functioning and the social consequences based on Ex IPS Officer Y.P. Singh’s novel ‘Carnage By Angels’. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search, similar photo found in a film review article published by ‘Koimoi’ film news website on ‘30 December 2011’. In the article, this photo is shared as a still from  Bollywood film ‘Kya Yahi Sach Hai’. It is also mentioned that this film is based on Ex IPS Officer Y.P. Singh’s novel ‘Carnage By Angels’. Also, it is stated that the story and screenplay of this movie have also been penned by Y.P Singh. The same photo was also shared in a review article published by ‘Sifi’ website.
On searching for this still in ‘Kya Yahi Sach Hai’ movie, uploaded by Ex-IPS officer Y.P. Singh on YouTube on ‘24 October 2016’, the same visual found in this movie at ‘1:48:18’ timestamp in this video. In the description of the video, Y.P. Singh mentioned that film is based on his experiences of deteriorating ethics in police functioning.
To sum it up, still from a Bollywood film ‘Kya Yahi Sach Hai’ falsely portrayed as the real picture of IPS officers in the country.
