This photo on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), supposedly of Nigerian President Bola Tinubu shaking hands with politician Peter Obi, is ALTERED.
The image depicts Obi bowing and shaking Tinubu’s hand.
“I want to collect tears of Obidients so please if you see this just share,” the post reads.
‘Obidients’ are members of a youth movement created to rally support for Obi ahead of the February 2023 Nigerian presidential election. Obi was Tinubu’s rival in the polls.
But is the image authentic?
A Google reverse image search established that the original image is of President Tinubu with Nigerian businessman and industrialist Aliko Dangote.
According to Tori.ng, the image was taken on 26 April 2023 during Dangote’s visit to Tinubu’s Abuja home.

The genuine photo was also shared by Olesegun Dada, President Tinubu’s special adviser on digital media, and published by Nation and Legit Nigeria.
In contrast to the image under investigation, the genuine photo features only the two individuals. President Tinubu’s photograph framed on the wall is not displayed.
Furthermore, in the doctored image, President Tinubu’s cap appears darker, whereas the cap in the authentic photo exhibits a distinct, lighter hue.
A Google search for the purported meeting and handshake did not yield credible results.
PesaCheck examined a photo on both Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), supposedly of the handshake between Nigerian President Bola Tinubu and politician Peter Obi, and found it to be ALTERED.
