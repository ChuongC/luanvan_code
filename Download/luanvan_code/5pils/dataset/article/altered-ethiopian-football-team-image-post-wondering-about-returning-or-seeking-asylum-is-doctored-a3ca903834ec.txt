An image of Ethiopian national football team players holding a t-shirt bearing text wondering if they should return home or seek asylum is ALTERED.
“Do you accept us if we come back home, or should we request asylum here [sic]” the altered Amharic text accompanying the photo translates.
The image shows two players holding a t-shirt while others are seen in the background.
The image was shared on 14 January 2022, after the African Cup of Nations 2021 hosts Cameroon defeated Ethiopia 4–1 on 13 January.
However, PesaCheck has learnt that the image of the Ethiopian football team has been doctored.
The original image shows the Walia ibex team holding a t-shirt bearing text in Amharic that reads, “let peace be upon Ethiopia ‘’. The photo was originally taken on 30 March 2021, when Ethiopia qualified for the African Cup of Nations on 30 March 2021.
The text on the original image was digitally manipulated and replaced with a text we are fact-checking.
PesaCheck has investigated an image of the Ethiopian national football team holding a t-shirt bearing “do you accept us if we come back home or should we seek asylum here [sic]”, and finds it to be ALTERED.
