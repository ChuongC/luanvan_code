A photo of Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu allegedly sending his son off to army duty during the current conflict is being shared on social media. Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.
Claim: Viral photo shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sending off his son to the ongoing war.Fact: This photo is Nine years old. This was taken in 2014 when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara bid farewell to their youngest son, Avner, when he was going for army training. Hence, the claim made in this post is Misleading.
A reverse image search of this photo revealed that the photo was taken almost nine years ago. It was taken in 2014 when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara’s youngest son Avner left for army training and waved goodbye to them (here and here). Avner began his mandatory three-year army service in 2014 by joining the Combat Intelligence Collection Corps of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
“Like any parents sending their child off to the army,” Netanyahu said, “we are excited to see our son” begin his army service,” the Jerusalem Post reported. This evidence proves that the claim that the Prime Minister’s son has joined the military in the context of the current developments between Israel and the Palestine is untrue. 
To sum up, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s photo with his son, taken in 2014, is now shared with a false story linking it to the ongoing Israel-Palestine war.
