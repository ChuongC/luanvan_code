A Twitter post claiming to show Sudan’s former Assistant Minister for Defence,Colonel Ibrahim Shamseddin in detention is FALSE.
The post, which has since been deleted, was shared by Femi Fani-Kayode, a Nigerian politician. According to the tweet, Shamseddin had been declared dead in June 2008 but was recently discovered in a cell where he had been detained by ousted president Omar al-Bashir.
The image has also been shared severally on Twitter captioned with a similar claim
A reverse image search shows that the photo was first shared by BBC Journalist Roncliff Odit on his Twitter page in March 2019 during the drought that affected 14 counties in Kenya. The 2019 drought led to widespread starvation in Northern Kenya and parts of the Rift Valley.
Colonel Ibrahim Shamseddin died in April 2001 after a military plane he was travelling in crashed. Thirteen high ranking military officials also died in the crash.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the image shared on Twitter is that of Sudan’s former Assistant Defense Minister, Colonel Ibrahim Shamseddin and finds it to be FALSE.
