This image shared on Facebook purporting to be of the bodies of Wollega conflict victims in the Oromia region of Ethiopia is ALTERED.
The image accompanying Amharic text translates in part to; “It is not the Amhara people who are being massacred in Wollega. Even if they are Amharas, why are they being massacred? But the Muslims are the ones who are massacred and purported as Amhara ethnic is being massacred in Wollega.”
An image of bodies of purported war victims on the ground and under the government official’s feet is attached to the post. A similar photo was shared on this Facebook account.
However, Google reverse image search results and a manual search of the government officials’ social media accounts established that the image is a digital combination of two different photos.
The first image was posted on Adanech Abiebie, the Addis Ababa City mayor’s verified Facebook account, on 4 December 2022. The photo was flipped left to right and used to form the doctored image.
The second image was shared on this Twitter account on 4 December 2022, concerning an attack on the Amhara people in Wollega.
There is war in Oromia between the federal government of Ethiopia and the Oromo Liberation Army. Also, the Addis Standard reported protests across Oromia concerning the violence in the East Wollega zone of the Oromia region.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook image claiming to be of the bodies of Amhara victims in Wollega, the Oromia region, and found it to be ALTERED.
