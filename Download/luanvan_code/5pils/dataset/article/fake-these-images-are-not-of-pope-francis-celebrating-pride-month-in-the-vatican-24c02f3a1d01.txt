These images on Twitter, purportedly of Pope Francis celebrating Pride Month in the Vatican, are FAKE.
The images are of a smiling Pontiff draped in a rainbow-coloured flag associated with the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ+) community.
Pride Month is marked every June in the US, Europe, and other parts of the world to reflect justice, inclusion, and equality of the LGBTQ+ community.
However, the post does not indicate when the Pontiff celebrated LGBTQ Pride in the Vatican, and no details are given on the Holy See.
A careful study of the images shows inconsistencies. The pectoral cross that the Pontiff is wearing lacks definition despite being a close-up shot raising questions about its authenticity.
Additionally, the pectoral cross does not contain the symbol of “Jesus Christ the Good Shepherd” to reflect the pastoral mission of the Bishop of Rome.

A reverse image search locates the images to a Facebook post shared on 3 April 2023 by a user known as “Gay Forest”. The text accompanying the images includes hashtags, one of them being MidJourney. Midjourney is a San Francisco-based research lab famous for its generative artificial intelligence programme.
PesaCheck has examined the images on Twitter purportedly of Pope Francis celebrating LGBTQ Pride Month in the Vatican and found them to be FAKE.
