A Time magazine cover dated 19 July 2017, with an image of former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga is FAKE.
The magazine cover was shared on social media on 16 August 2022, a day after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) announced the president-elect.
William Ruto was declared the president-elect on 15 August 2022, after a hotly contested election pitting him against Azimio la Umoja’s Raila Odinga, Roots Party’s George Wajackoyah, and Agano Party’s David Mwaure.
The Time magazine cover, which is an “African Issue”, bears the headline “The man who will never be president” next to Odinga’s image.
There is also a brief explainer just below the main headline that reads: “With over 20 years of trying to clinch the top seat in Kenya is Raila done?”
The cover also has four other headlines on the roofline and another headline below Odinga’s story. All these headlines are about Africa.
To check whether the cover is authentic, we visited the Time Vault, where Time magazine stores all the covers it has ever published. We filtered our search to 2017 and discovered that the publication did not publish an issue on 19 July 2017. The only magazines that were published close to that date include the 10 July and 24 July 2017 issues.
Both of these editions did not have Odinga on their cover. Instead, the Game of Thrones cast was featured on the 10 July 2017 issue while Donald Trump Junior was on the 24 July 2017 cover.
Time magazine has published an article on how to spot a fake Time cover. The cover we are fact-checking fails to meet some of the standard requirements in a legitimate Time cover. They include a red border around the edges of the cover, a thin white border that separates the red from the image, and the use of rooflines.
“No longer do we feature “rooflines” above the logo that point readers to stories inside. Instead, the cover takes on a poster-like feel with a mission to create a simple and impactful message,” the Time article warns.
PesaCheck has looked into a Time magazine cover dated 19 July 2017, with an image of former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga and finds it to be FAKE.
