A heart-shaped image of a city is being shared widely on social media claiming that it’s an aerial view of the city of Venice. A twitter user also posted the same image on 30 June 2022 with the title – “ Venice, Italy”. This tweet has over 298K likes and 26K retweets. The same image was shared previously on various social media platforms by different users. Let us fact-check the claim.
Claim: Aerial view of heart-shaped Venice city.
Fact: The original image is mirrored and then edited to look like a heart-shaped city. Hence the claim is FALSE.
Upon careful inspection of the image, it is evident that all the elements on both left and right sides of the image like boats, structures, tomb etc. resemble each other.
On reverse image search, we found that the image was originally posted on Instagram by “Lennart Pagel Photography” on 14 February 2021.
Upon looking at the satellite images of Venice city, We can conclude that Venice is not a heart shaped city.
To sum it up, the viral heart-shaped image of Venice city is just a mirrored image and not a real one.
