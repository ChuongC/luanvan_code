A Facebook post with images claiming to be of a drone hit by the Tigray Defence Force (TDF) is FALSE.
The image is accompanied by a post in Amharic that translates to; “Breaking news. The Fascist group has been committing Genocide against the people of Tigray in collaboration with foreign invaders. In this process, the hero TDF used anti-drone countermeasures and hit a drone made by Turkey near Shire town today. Tigray will win.”
A similar claim was shared on Instagram as seen here.
However, Google and Bing reverse image search results established that the images are unrelated to the conflict in northern Ethiopia.
The first image was shared on the VOD website on 28 January 2020 with the caption, “A fixed-wing drone discovered in Koh Kong province on January 16, 2020, in this photograph posted to Information Minister Khieu Kanharith’s Facebook page.”
The second image along with the first one was published on this website on 17 January 2020, in an article about a drone that “crashed in Smach village, Cambodia”.
Although the post claims to be of a drone hit by TDF in October 2022, the images have been online since 2020.
The Tigray forces and the federal government of Ethiopia agreed to halt the two-year civil war following the African Union-led peace talks held in South Africa.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with images claiming to be of a drone hit by the Tigray Defence Force and found it to be FALSE.
