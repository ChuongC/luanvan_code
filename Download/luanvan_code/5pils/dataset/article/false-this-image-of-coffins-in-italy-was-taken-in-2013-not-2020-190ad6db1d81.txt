A photo shared on Facebook claiming to show coffins bearing bodies of COVID-19 victims in Italy in 2020 has been taken out of context and contains false information.
Italy has reported the highest number of COVID-19 deaths and infections in Europe. As of March 19, the country had 41,035 cases and 3,405 deaths, surpassing the 3,133 deaths reported in China.
While a reverse image search shows that the image was taken in Italy, it shows the coffins of African immigrants drowned when the boat they were in sank off the Italian island of Lampedusa. It was taken in October 2013, and has been credited to Tullio M. Puglia.
An article by the BBC reporting on the incident states that the boat, which was estimated to have 500 passengers, had left Misrata in Libya when its engine stalled. The passengers lit a fire as a distress signal, but it spread to the rest of the boat. More than 100 people died and 200 others could not be accounted for.
PesaCheck has looked into this post claiming to show coffins of COVID-19 victims in Italy and finds it to be MISLEADING.
