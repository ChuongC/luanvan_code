A Facebook post with a photo purportedly of Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya leader Raila Odinga watching President William Ruto’s media roundtable interview is FALSE.
The text accompanying the photo shared online on 4 January 2023, reads: “Baba watching dictator William Ruto akidanganya wakenya (lying to Kenyans). Baba ako na roho Safi (Baba has a clean heart).”
Baba is the moniker for Odinga.
President Ruto held a media roundtable interview on 4 January 2023 and spoke about his 100 days since taking office.
But does the photo show Odinga watching the media roundtable interview?
We performed a reverse search and established that the photo was taken in September 2022.
The original photo was taken as Odinga was following the Supreme Court presidential election petition ruling on 2 September 2022 on Citizen TV and NTV.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a photo purportedly of Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya leader Raila Odinga watching President William Ruto’s media roundtable interview in January 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
