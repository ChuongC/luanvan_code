A tweet with images claiming to show a fatal shooting in Mutungo, a Kampala suburb, on May 11, 2021, is FALSE.
The post identifies a man in a photo lying down as Gordon Sebagala, who was ‘shot dead’ by his captors at a petrol station. The post adds that such killings are happening in Uganda.
Two images are attached to the post — the first, a collage of two photos showing a likely arrest and a body on the ground. The second is a larger picture of a dead man in a black trouser and red shirt lying on the ground. An armed man wearing fatigues appears in the foreground of the second photo.
According to the post, the images show Mr Sebagala’s body lying on the ground, after he was shot by his ‘captures’ (sic) at a fuel station in Mutungo.
However, a Google reverse search shows the image used in the post was taken in 2019, when police shot and killed a suspected robber, and injured another at a Total fuel station in Nsambya, owned by former opposition leader, Kizza Besigye.
No results are yielded for the other image used in the collage, showing a likely arrest.
