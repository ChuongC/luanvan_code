A Facebook post claiming to show supporters of the National Unity Platform (NUP) party who were tortured by the Uganda Police is FALSE.
The post has two images and claims they show NUP team members who have been mistreated by the Uganda government and the police force at Kasijagirwa barracks.
The first image shows a semi-clothed civilian trussed up on the ground while two people wearing what appears to be military uniform watch. The second image is of a man with visible welts that look like they were caused by lashes on the back.
In recent weeks, a series of arrests and claims of torture of NUP supporters have been levelled against the Uganda Police Force. NUP is led by Robert Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine, who is vying for presidency in the January 2021 elections.
However, none of the photos were taken in Uganda. A Google reverse image search of the first photo shows that it was taken from Cameroon and first started circulating online in 2016. The image was taken during protests in the West African nation as English-speaking Cameroonians clashed with the military. The image was featured in a petition here.
A Google reverse image search on the second image — of a shirtless man with back injuries — shows it was captured in Zimbabwe. The image started circulating online in January 2019, following violent protests in the country’s capital, Harare. The image was featured by The Times and The BBC.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with two images claiming to show National Unity Platform party supporters tortured by the Uganda Police and finds it to be FALSE.
