A Facebook post with an assortment of images showing protestors and burning tyres and a claim that these were taken in Kyadondo, Uganda, in January 2021, is FALSE.
The claim, posted right after Uganda’s January 14 election, suggests that Kyadondo, which is home to opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine, is on fire.
Results of the presidential election announced by Uganda’s Electoral Commission show Bobi Wine garnered 34 percent of the vote, trailing behind the incumbent, Yoweri Museveni, with 58 percent, in a field of 11 contenders. The Kyadondo East legislator and his supporters have since expressed dissatisfaction and doubts as to the integrity of the vote count.
A Google reverse search of image 3 reveals that it was taken two days before the 2016 presidential election, when supporters of opposition politician Kizza Besigye burnt posters of President Museveni in Kampala.
Image 1 and image 2 were taken on Kalangala Island, Uganda, in December 2020 during protests demanding the freeing of Bobi Wine. He was arrested for ‘violating health and safety protocols’.
Image 4 dates to April 2020, during protests following the arrest of Ugandan legislator Francis Zaake, for flouting presidential directives while distributing relief food during the COVID-19 lockdown.
PesaCheck has looked into a claim that images posted on Facebook showing street protests, fires and smoke were taken in Kyadondo, Uganda, in January 2021, and finds it to be FALSE.
