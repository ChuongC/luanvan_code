This image on Facebook purportedly of a man who lost his real estate business in the February 2023 earthquake in Türkiye is FALSE.
The image is of a senior citizen holding loaves of bread in one hand and seemingly wiping tears with the other hand.
Behind him is a building that sustained structural damage. It stands amid rubble strewn all around it.
According to the Facebook post, the scene is a depiction of how life often takes a dramatic turn for the worst and readers are urged to draw important lessons from it.
“It took just 17 seconds to change this Man’s status from the Owner of 3 buildings in Turkey to a person surviving on bread and finding shelter wherever he can. Life is fragile and also speaks about the depravity of mankind. Turkey earthquake teaches us all an important lesson that life is unpredictable and nothing is permanent. Let’s try to be humble, respectful and kind and above all Trust in the almighty God,” the post reads.
The image was widely shared after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Türkiye on 8 February 2023 in the southeastern part of the country near the border with Syria. It is estimated that more than 46 000 people died in Türkiye and over 1,400 in Syria.
A reverse image search brings up a 2020 study published by researchgate.net with the image. According to the picture description, the image is of an “old man” with the bread after the 17 August 1999 earthquake.
The image is attributed to photographer Abdurrahman Antakyali of Türkiye picture agency Depo Photos.
PesaCheck found the image on Antyakali’s 2014 Instagram page where he confirms that he took the picture during the 1999 earthquake at Düzce, an area between Ankara, the capital city, and Istanbul, the port city.
PesaCheck has examined the image of a man, who purportedly lost his real estate business in the February 2023 earthquake in Türkiye, and found it to be FALSE.
