A Facebook post with an image claiming to show an Ethiopian Air Force attack on Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) fighters is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo post shared on 3 October 2022 translates to; “The heroic Ethiopian Air Force has inflicted great losses on the TPLF at three fronts in its successful attack today. In this situation, our Air Force successfully attacked Barile, Raya, and Adigrat. Victory for our Air Force.”
Northern Ethiopia has been engulfed in war since November 2020, after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent the army to dislodge Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) regional authorities from power, accusing them of attacking military bases.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo in the claim is not related to the conflict in Ethiopia.
The photo was published on this website on 14 April 2020 in an article titled: “The US and NATO secretly searched for the body of Russia’s “war god” Su-27SM3 that had just crashed.”
The picture was also published on this website on 6 November 2019, in an article with the title, “Russian Su-27 intercepted US and Swedish aircraft.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of the Ethiopian Air Force attacking Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) fighters and finds it to be FALSE.
