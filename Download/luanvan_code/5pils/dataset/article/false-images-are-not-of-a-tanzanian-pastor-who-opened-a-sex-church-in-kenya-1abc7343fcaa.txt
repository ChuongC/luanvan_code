A Facebook post with images claiming to be of a pastor, who opened a ‘sex church’ in Kenya, is FALSE.
According to the post, the pastor intends to open other branches in South Africa and Malawi.
A Google reverse image search of the first picture shows an article by The Standard featuring the photos in the claim.
The article has the headline, “I am sane: Preacher pictured kissing wife and house help denounces govt report.”
The article identifies the preacher as Onesmo Machibya alias Nabii Tito, who it alleges “was deemed mentally unfit by Tanzanian authorities following a medical check-up” in 2018.
A reverse search of the last image in the claim leads to an article dated 24 January 2018 showing Tito drinking from what seems to be a beer bottle, while holding a Bible in the other hand.
In a video showing his arrest, Tito was accused of incitement against religion and misleading his followers with a non-existent doctrine.
The title of the video is: “‘Prophet Tito’ tells the commander ‘I use the Bible’”.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with images claiming to be of a pastor, who opened a ‘sex church’ in Kenya, and finds it to be FALSE.
