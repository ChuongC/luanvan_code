An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman Wafula Chebukati in a prisoner’s uniform is ALTERED.
In the image, Chebukati holds a card identifying him as an “Electoral Fraud criminal”.
The image suggests that Chebukati has been imprisoned for offences related to electoral malpractice.
Although multiple petitions have been filed challenging the credibility of the August 2022 presidential election results, no ruling has been made so far.
We did a reverse search and established that the image we are debunking is doctored. The original image was published in August 2017 and featured prisoners lining up to vote in that year’s general election.
The prisoner captured at the front of the line is not Chebukati, nor is he holding the card with the words “ELECTORAL FRAUD CRIMINAL” featured in the image we are fact-checking.
The August 2017 general election was the first for prisoners to vote in the country. They were, however, allowed to vote only in the presidential election.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming to show Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman Wafula Chebukati in a prisoner’s uniform and finds it to be ALTERED.
