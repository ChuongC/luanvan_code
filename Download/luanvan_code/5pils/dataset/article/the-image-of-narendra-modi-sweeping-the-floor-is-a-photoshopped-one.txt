An image of a person holding a broom and cleaning the floor is being shared widely on social media claiming that the person in the picture is Narendra Modi before he became the Prime Minister of India. Let’s try to check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image ofNarendra Modi sweeping the floor before he became the PrimeMinister of India.
Fact: An RTI reply regarding the image has revealed that it is a photoshopped one and the person in the photo is not Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So. the claim is FALSE.    
When the image in the post is subjected to Yandex reverse image search technique, many search results were obtained. Several of those search results had a similar image to the one in the post except for the face of the person in the image.
When searched on Google with keywords ‘Modi cleaning floor photo’, a link of ‘Janta ka Reporter’ was obtained in the search results. From that article, it was found that when an Ahmedabad-based activist had sought information under the Right to Information (RTI) Act to check the authenticity of that image, he got a reply saying that the photograph is a morphed one and the person in that is not Narendra Modi. So, the image in the post is a photoshopped one.
To conclude, the image in the post is a photoshopped one.
