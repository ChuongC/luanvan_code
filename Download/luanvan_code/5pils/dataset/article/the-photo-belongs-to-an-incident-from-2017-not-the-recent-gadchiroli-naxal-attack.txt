A photo showing cardboard boxes is being shared on Facebook with the claim that bodies of policemen killed in Gadchiroli Naxal attack were kept in those boxes. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: Dead bodies of brave policemen killed in Gadchiroli Naxal attack were wrapped in boxes.
Fact: There are dead bodies in those boxes but those belong to military personnel who died in Tawang Helicopter crash, in 2017. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
When the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search, a Hindustan Times article containing the same image can be found in the search results. According to that article, in 2017, when the former Northern Army commander Lt Gen (Retd) HS Panag tweeted about the wrapping of martyred military personnel in such boxes, the Army’s Additional Directorate General of Public Information tweeted “Mortal remains of heptr accident in HAA on 6 Oct 17 recovered, sent wrapped in local resources is an aberration” and “Fallen soldiers always given full military honour. Carriage of mortal remains in body bags, wooden boxes, coffins will be ensured”. So, an old photo is being shared again with misleading claims.
To sum it up, the photo belongs to an incident from 2017, not recent Gadchiroli Naxal attack.
