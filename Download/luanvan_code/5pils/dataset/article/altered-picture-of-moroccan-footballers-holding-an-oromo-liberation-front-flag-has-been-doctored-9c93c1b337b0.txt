This photo shared on Facebook showing Moroccan footballers holding an Oromo Liberation Front (OLA) flag is ALTERED.
OLF is an Ethiopia-based political party formed in 1973.
The image is accompanied by an Afaan Oromo text that translates to; “The youth of Morocco said that we will promote the Oromo and the Oromo identity to the world in every possible way.”
On 10 December 2022, Morocco made history as the first African team to reach a World Cup semifinal with a 1–0 win against Portugal.
Research by PesaCheck shows that the picture has been manipulated to create the impression that the Moroccan footballers were holding the OLA flag.
A reverse image search shows that the photo has been used since 6 December 2022. The original photo is of Moroccan footballer Ilias Emilian Chair and two teammates holding the Moroccan flag. The photo was published on Chair’s official instagram account.
PesaCheck has examined an image shared on Facebook claiming to be of Moroccan footballer holding an Oromo liberation Front flag and finds it to have been ALTERED.
