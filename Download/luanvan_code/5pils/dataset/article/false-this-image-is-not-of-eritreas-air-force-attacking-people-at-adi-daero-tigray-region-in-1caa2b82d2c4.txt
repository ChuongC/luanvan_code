This Facebook post claiming to show Eritrea’s Air Force jet that attacked and injured people at Adi Daero in the Tigray region is FALSE.
The Amharic text accompanying the picture translates as; “Breaking: Eritrea’s invading air force has injured many people by beating innocent people at Adi Daero. Even today evening, the Eritrean force continued attacking innocent people and their property at the place called Adi Kokob. The debts of Ethiopia and Eritrea are increasing.”
Adi Daero is a woreda or a district in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the image is unrelated to Ethiopia’s conflict that began in November 2020. Instead, it shows a Russian MiG-35 multirole fighter.
The picture was published on the Nghê An website on 5 September 2016, in the article, “5 most popular Russian weapons in the world”. The caption indicates it is “Russia’s MiG-35 multirole fighter”. The image is credited to Wikipedia.
The same image was also published on this website in March 2013.
On 28 September 2022, the BBC reported that new satellite imagery showed a military build-up in Eritrea near the border with Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region. Media reports have indicated that Eritrean troops have been backing Ethiopian government forces in the war against the Tigray regional forces.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show Eritrea’s Air Force jet attacking people at Adi Daero in the Tigray region of Ethiopia and finds it to be FALSE.
