A Facebook post purportedly showing Citizen TV referring to Raila Odinga as a Bondo resident is ALTERED.
The post reads: “From prime minister to mkaazi wa Bondo[] Weeeeh[][][][][][][][][][][][][][] Citizen TV Kenya [][][][][][].”
The image has Citizen TV’s branding and describes Odinga as ‘Mkaazi, Bondo’, which is Swahili for a Bondo resident.
Bondo is a town in Siaya County of Kenya, from which Odinga hails.
A look through the broadcaster’s YouTube page indicates it is a video of Odinga’s address on 3 November 2022, with images that match the one in question. The original clip, however, does not have the description in the claim.
The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader was addressing the media on extrajudicial killings in the country.
The title reads: “Raila demands ‘transparent, inclusive public inquiry’ into disappearances and extrajudicial killings.”
To further authenticate the claim, PesaCheck contacted Philip Mwaniki, the Digital Editor at Royal Media Services (RMS), the company that owns Citizen TV, who dismissed it as “Fake”.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post purportedly showing Citizen TV referring to Raila Odinga as a Bondo resident and finds it to be ALTERED.
