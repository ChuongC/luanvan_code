A tweet with an image claiming to show the grave of Uganda’s deceased Speaker of Parliament Jacob Oulanyah is FALSE.
The tweet alleges the image attached is that of Oulanyah’s grave, which “cost a lot of money”.
However, a Google reverse search shows that the image is not of a grave and has nothing to do with Oulanyah’s funeral.
Instead, the image shows the foundation of a swimming pool and several photos have been published on Facebook to show the stage by stage process of the ongoing construction.
Oulanyah passed away in Seattle, USA, on 20 March 2022, and is due to be buried on 8 April 2022. At the time of his death, he was the serving Speaker of Parliament in Uganda.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image claiming to show the grave of the late Ugandan Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Oulanyah, and finds it to be FALSE.
