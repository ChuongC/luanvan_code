An image shared on Facebook claiming to show the Chelenqo massacre commemoration ceremony on 2 March 2022 is PARTLY FALSE.
The picture is accompanied by a post in Amharic, which translates, “Menelik’s cruelty was remembered at Chelenqo. As long as there are agents who promote this rhetoric, it cannot be said that this is history. It cannot be said that Menelik’s era is over as long as there are carriers of his ideology. Whenever they mention Menelik… you have to express his cruelty on your part … It is an obligation!!”
The battle of Chelenqo was held in 1887 between Emperor Menelik ll and Amir Abdullahi of Harar.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo was not taken during the commemoration ceremony on 2 March 2022.
While the image does show a memorial monument erected to commemorate the Chelenqo massacre, it was published in an article on the Oromian Economist website in 2015 and not in 2022.
Also, the same image was published on the Madda Walaabuu Press on 22 March 2015 corroborating the information that the picture was taken in 2015.
On 2 March 2022, the 126th anniversary of the Victory of Adwa was celebrated in different parts of Ethiopia. The event is marked to celebrate the victory obtained after a military clash between the Ethiopian and the Italian invading forces at Adwa in 1896, during the era of Emperor Menelik ll.
