A Facebook account bearing the name and image of Dr Roselyne Akombe, a former commissioner of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), and a post with a doctored photo is FAKE.
The post shows a picture of former US President Barack Obama and President-Elect Joe Biden holding a photo of Kenya’s Deputy President William Ruto.
Dr Akombe has distanced herself from both the Facebook post and account.
Speaking to PesaCheck via Facebook Messenger, Ms Akombe said that the account doesn’t belong to her.
Ms Akombe uses the name Dr Roselyn Akombe on Facebook, and has a verified Twitter account and a personal website.
Facebook Transparency Information for the imposter account shows that it was created on August 3, 2016, and the name of the account has been changed three times.
The legitimate Dr Roselyn Akombe Facebook account was created on July 25, 2018 in the US, where the former elections official lives.
PesaCheck also verified the authenticity of the photo.
A reverse image search reveals that the photo has been altered. The original photo shows the two men holding a campaign poster at a rally in Michigan when former President Obama joined then-presidential candidate Biden on the campaign trail in Michigan USA.
PesaCheck has looked at the authenticity of a Facebook page claiming to belong to former IEBC commissioner Roselyn Akombe with a post sharing a fabricated photo of former US President Barack Obama and US President-Elect Joe Biden, and finds it to be FAKE.
