A tweet with an image claiming to show flags in Kenya flown half-mast on March 13, 2021 is FALSE.
A Google reverse image search shows that the photo is not recent and has been published several times in the past. The image was published with an article on The Star news website in 2016. The caption attached to the image reads, “Several flags flying at half-mast at the Kenyatta mausoleum in Nairobi on the first day of national mourning following the Westgate attack”.
The Westgate Mall attack occurred in September 2013.
The Kenyan flag is traditionally flown at half-mast as a national symbol of mourning as happened following the death of Kenya’s former President Daniel arap Moi, Burundi’s President Pierre Nkurunziza, and former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
On Wednesday, March 17, 2021 Tanzania’s President John Magufuli died aged 61 of heart complications at a hospital in Dar es Salaam. The Vice President of Tanzania Samia Suluhu Hassan made the announcement in an address on Tanzania’s state television.
President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday, March 18, 2021 sent his condolences following the death of President Magufuli in an address to the nation from State House. President Kenyatta noted that the flag of Kenya and that of the East African Community will be flown at half-mast throughout Kenya and all diplomatic missions abroad from Thursday until the sunset on the day of Magufuli’s funeral.
