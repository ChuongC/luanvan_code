An image is being shared on social media claiming it as visuals of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi holding Trishul while offering prayers in a temple. In the wake of Priyanka Gandhi’s visits to temples in Uttar Pradesh, this post satirically calls Priyanka Gandhi an upcoming Radhe Maa type God-woman in the country. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Priyanka Gandhi holding Trishul while offering prayers in a temple.
Fact: The photo shared in the post is a morphed one. The original photo does not show Priyanka Gandhi holding a Trishul in her hand. This photo was shot in March 2019, when she offered prayers at the Vindhyavasini temple in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. 
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar photo was found in an article published by the ‘INDIA TV’ news website on 19 March 2019.  This article reported it as the visuals of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi offering prayers at Vindhyavasini temple in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh. But the original photo published in the ‘India TV’ article did not show Priyanka Gandhi holding Trishul in her hand.
Reporting Priyanka Gandhi’s 2019  visit to the Vindhyavasini temple in Mirzapur, several other news websites published the same original photo in their articles. They can be seen here and here.
To sum it up, this photo of Priyanka Gandhi holding Trishul while offering prayers in a temple is a morphed one.
