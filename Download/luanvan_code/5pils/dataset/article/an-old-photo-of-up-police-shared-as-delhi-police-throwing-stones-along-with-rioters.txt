 A photo of a policeman throwing a stone is being shared widely on social media with a claim that it shows Delhi Police throwing stones along with rioters in Delhi. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post. 
Claim: Photo of a Delhipoliceman throwing stones along with rioters in Delhi.
Fact: The photo was taken on 19 December 2019 in Lucknow. It shows Uttar Pradesh Police, not Delhi Police. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.    
When the photo was run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found on the ‘Getty Images’ website. On the website, the photo has the following description: ‘Police throw stones towards protesters during demonstrations against India’s new citizenship law in Lucknow on December 19, 2019’. Also, the posted photo is a cropped photo. In the full version, the address of the shop in the background suggests that the photo was taken in Lucknow. So, the photo is not related to recent riots in Delhi.
To sum it up, an
old photo of UP Police shared as ‘Delhi Police throwing stones along with
rioters’.
