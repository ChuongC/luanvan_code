A Facebook post claiming to show an image of a chopper that was donated to Uganda’s former presidential candidate, Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, is ALTERED.
The post, written in Luganda, translates as, “These people love the president and have already donated a chopper to him”. It is accompanied with a photo of a chopper painted with text referring to Bobi Wine as president elect 2021–2026.
Bobi Wine lost in the January 2021 presidential race with 34 percent, to incumbent Yoweri Museveni who secured 58 percent of the vote, according to results announced by the Electoral Commission (EC).
Bobi Wine protested these results in the Supreme Court of Uganda through a petition he eventually withdrew, citing judicial bias and instead called for peaceful protests against the regime.
Mr Museveni was then sworn in as Uganda’s ninth president, for his sixth term.
A Google reverse search of the image reveals that the original photo is of an Alabama LifeSaver chopper, registration number N93CH, taken on November 17, 2004, on the pad at Carraway Methodist Medical Center, Alabama, US.
PesaCheck has looked into a post claiming to show an image of a chopper that was donated to Uganda’s former presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine, and finds it to be ALTERED.
