A tweet claiming to show a man with deep cuts on his body as a tortured Ugandan is FALSE.
The wounded man’s photo that accompanies the tweet reads, “Unfortunately no one to help Uganda# Uganda is bleeding,”.
However, a reverse image search on TinEye shows that the image used in the tweet dates back to 2017, and was not originally taken in Uganda.
A Google reverse image search shows the image appeared in a post on Nairaland, a Nigerian internet forum and social networking website, dated March 4, 2017.
The image has also been widely circulated on Pinterest and has been linked to slavery in Libya.
Through the phrase and hashtag “Uganda is Bleeding” on social media, a section of Ugandans have sought to highlight allegations of abduction and torture of opposition supporters before and after the January 2021 general election.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet claiming to show a tortured man in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
