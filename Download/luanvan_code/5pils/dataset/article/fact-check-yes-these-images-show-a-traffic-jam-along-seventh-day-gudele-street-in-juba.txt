There was heavy traffic along Saint Kizito – Gudele street. If you look closely, there are water tanks common in South Sudan.

A Facebook post on 24th November 2022 by Paam Ke sharing pictures of a traffic jam along Gudele street in South Sudan’s capital city, Juba, is true.
“A traffic jam at Seventh Day Round about this evening. A lot of cars…,” partly reads the post‘s caption in which the pictures were shared.
But people said different things. Some people in the crowd were not sure if the photos were really taken on Gudele Street in Juba.
“I don’t think it’s the Seventh-day – Gudele street,” wonders one Mr. Malish Michael
“You are lying we don’t have these types of cars in South Sudan. Stop lying,” warned another.
Which begs the question, where exactly were these pictures taken? Why don’t we find out?
Using visual cues, one could see similar structures along the roads, an MTN billboard in the far left corner, a mGurush billboard in the far right ends, and some water tank trucks, which are common in Juba.

A search on Facebook for “Gudele jam” yielded the same images that were first posted on November 24th, 2022, at 5:01 pm by Advance Digital, a Juba-based mainstream media company.
“Heavy Traffic Jam around St Kizito,” it captioned the pictures.
According to our observations, the photos were taken from the upper level of the building where Advance Digital is located, Star Village.


Conclusion: 
211 Check confirms that these photographs were taken on November 24, 2022, along Seventh-day – Gudele Street. They were taken from an aerial view of the Star Village Building, which is located on this road.
