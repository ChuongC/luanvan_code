This tweet with an image of bodies supposedly of ethnic Amhara civilians massacred in Gobu Seyo town, Eastern Wollega, in February 2023 is FALSE.
The post reads: “Oromo terrorists (OLF) with the help of Oromo region forces go door to door & massacre over 100 Amhara civilians in Gobu Seyo county, Eastern Wollega, Ethiopia.”
The tweet is accompanied by an image of covered bodies on the ground, with some men standing next to them.
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) reported at least 50 people, including women and children, were killed in an attack on an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp in East Wollega zone, Gobu Seyu Woreda and Ano town of the Oromia regional state. The attack happened between 2 and 4 February 2023. The perpetrators were dressed in military uniform, who residents claimed were members of the Oromo Liberation Army.
However, Google reverse image search results indicated that the image under investigation is old, and precedes the February 2023 attack on civilians in Gobu Seyu.
The photo was shared in the comment section of a post on the FastMereja.net Facebook page on 12 January 2021, alongside an Amharic text that reads: “Politics is stupid”.
We could not independently verify the first use case of the picture, but the evidence confirms it was not taken in February 2023.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image of bodies supposedly of ethnic Amhara civilians massacred in Gobu Seyo town, Eastern Wollega, in February 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
