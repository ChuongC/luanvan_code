An image shared on Facebook claiming to show the chairman of the Balderas for True Democracy (Balderas) party Eskinder Nega in prison is ALTERED.
The image shows Ethiopian politician Eskinder in orange overalls and is accompanied by the text “T-BAG”.
On 20 April 2022, the Balderas party published a post on its official Facebook account saying its leader and other members were arrested at Arba Minch in the night and released in the morning.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the photo used to advance the claim has been doctored.
The original image, which is a stock photo, shows an African American person behind bars. The image appears in various photo repositories as seen here and here.
PesaCheck has looked into an image shared on Facebook claiming to show the chairman of the Balderas party, Eskinder Nega, in prison and finds it to be ALTERED.
