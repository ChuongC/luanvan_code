This tweet with an image purportedly of ethnic Oromo people massacred by Fano (ethnic Amhara youth group) and Eritrean forces in December 2022 is FALSE.
The text accompanying the image reads: “Abiy’s regime, Fano terrorists, and Eritrean forces are committing Genocide against Oromos across Oromia. Oromo Lives Matter.”
Fano refers to Amhara armed youths.
Mass killings were reportedly committed when a conflict erupted recently in Wollega, in Ethiopia’s Oromia regional state.
On 3 December 2022, Addis Standard reported that militants (Fano) from the neighbouring Amhara region killed dozens of people in the Kiremu district of the East Wollega zone. This happened between 25 and 29 November 2022, according to the publication.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the photo in the claim is of a mass burial of Amhara people in Metekel, Benishangul, on 20 December 2020.
The Amhara Genocide website published the image on 7 April 2022, alongside a text that read: “Genocide and Mass grave of Ethnic Amharas and Agews in Metekela Benishangul Gumuz on 22 December 2020.”
Additionally, this Twitter account posted the image on 25 December 2020 with a text part of which read: “Mass burial of Amhara/Agew taking place in Metekel, Benishangul, Ethiopia, today!”
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image claiming to be of Oromia people massacred by Fano and Eritrean forces in December 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
