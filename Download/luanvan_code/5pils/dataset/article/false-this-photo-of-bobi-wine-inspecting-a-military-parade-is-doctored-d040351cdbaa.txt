A Facebook post with a photo of Ugandan legislator Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine, inspecting a military parade, with a claim he was “given the security to protect him” is FALSE.
Bobi Wine was the runner-up in the January 14 presidential election, garnering 34 percent against incumbent president Yoweri Museveni’s 58 percent in the poll. He has disputed the credibility and transparency of the elections and has challenged the results announced by the Electoral Commission in court.
Whereas the Presidential Elections Act requires the Electoral Commission to issue security to each presidential candidate during campaigns and at their places of residence, the image used in this claim is doctored.
A search of the image on Yandex reveals that the photo was taken in August 2017, when Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) commander, David Muhoozi, travelled to Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, to visit Ugandan peacekeeping troops serving with the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).
PesaCheck has looked into a photo showing Bobi Wine inspecting a military parade and finds it has been DOCTORED.
