An image is being shared by many pages on Facebook with the title ‚ÄúIndian plane shot down‚Äù. Let‚Äôs try to analyze whether there is any truth in the image posted on Facebook

Claim:¬†The plane shown in the image is an Indian plane shot down by the Pakistan defense forces
Fact:¬†The image posted is a MIG-27 which crashed in Jodhpur in 2016. So, the claim of it being an Indian plane shot down by the Pakistan defense forces is FALSE.

When the plane number (TU657), which is visible in the image posted, is searched in the Google a link to the NDTV Twitter post on the plane crash can be found. According to the Twitter post, it is a MIG-27 plane which crashed in Jodhpur and the pilots of the plane are found to be alive. Also, if the time stamp of the post is observed, it can be concluded that it is an incident which took place in 2016. So, it is no way related to the recent conflict.
Finally, the image posted on Facebook was taken at a plane crash in 2016.

Yes and the pilot captured is also a pakistani
