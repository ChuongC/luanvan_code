This photo on Facebook purportedly of former Kenyan Interior Cabinet Secretary (CS) Fred Matiang’i behind bars at Central Police Station on 7 March 2023 is FALSE.
“Breaking news Matiang’i currently detained at Central police, power is transcient (sic) and temporary,” the text accompanying the photo reads.
Matiang’i, on 7 March 2023, appeared at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters on Kiambu Road in Nairobi, in response to summons over claims of publishing false information.
But is the photo of Matiang’i behind bars at Central Police?
We performed a reverse search on the image and got negative results on Google, Yandex and TinEye.
Since the photo has The Star newspaper’s watermark, we reviewed the publication’s website, Twitter and Facebook pages — where it shares all its news items — and established that the image was published on 7 March 2023.
According to The Star, the photo was taken at the DCI headquarters.
According to the timestamp, the fake post was published at 10.38 a.m.
However, at 12.26 p.m, lawyer Otiende Amollo confirmed that he and legal colleagues, who accompanied Matiang’i for the interrogation, were still at the DCI headquarters.
After the interrogation, the ex-CS was released from the DCI headquarters at about 5.00 p.m.
A keyword search for any stories on Matiang’i’s purported detention at Central Police yielded negative results.
PesaCheck has looked into an image on Facebook claiming to be of former Kenyan Interior Cabinet Secretary (CS) Fred Matiang’i behind bars at Central Police Station on 7 March 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
