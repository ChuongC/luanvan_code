A Facebook post with an image claiming to show the destruction inflicted on Mekelle city by Ethiopian Defence Forces is FALSE.
The image appears to have been captured at night, in the middle of a highway, with a silhouette of trucks seen against huge flames of fire and a thick cloud of smoke billowing above the scene.
The post accompanying the image is written in Amharic and translates to say that the action taken by the air force has destroyed Mekelle city.
Mekelle is the capital city of Ethiopiaâ€™s Tigray region, which has been rocked by fighting between pro-government forces and the Tigray People Liberation Force (TPLF).
On November 22, 2020, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced the second phase of the military offensive to recover lost campsites and looted weapons, and to rescue members of the National Defence Forces held captive by the TPLF.
However, a Google reverse image search reveals that the photo is not related to the conflict in Mekelle and was not taken there.
The same image was published together with an article by news website thesouthafrican.com, about a petrol bomb attack on November 19, 2020. Several trucks were torched by arsonists in Gauteng, shutting down two highways in the South African province.
The article credits the image to Twitter and includes several tweets with images and videos showing the incident.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with an image claiming to show massive destruction in Mekelle City purportedly inflicted by Ethiopian forces, and finds it to be FALSE.
