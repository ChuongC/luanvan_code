A Facebook post with an image purportedly of two men arrested for being in possession of human bones in Kenya is FALSE.
“Wait a minute ……forget Kiambu first …This (sic) two young men have been arrested with human bones. They say they use them to make bracelets..My country Kenya….Soo are they exhuming dead bodies or what?” the post, which is partly written in Swahili, reads.
The image is of two men holding what appear to be human skulls and a suitcase stuffed with bones.
There is no information on the alleged arrest from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations — Kenya (DCI), National Police Service — Kenya, Kenya Police Service or a credible local media outlet.
A Google reverse image search shows an article dated 14 October 2022 featuring the image in question.
The headline reads: “Police arrest 2 men with human skull in Adamawa (photos)”.
The Daily Trust, a Nigerian publication, also reported on the arrest on 13 October 2022, identifying the two suspects as Nodji Kodji and Raji Silver, from a community in Cameroon’s Garware village.
According to the article, “both suspects had confessed to stealing the skulls and bones from a graveyard in a certain village in the Cameroon Republic and bringing them to Nigeria to sell.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly showing two men arrested in possession of human bones in Kenya and finds it to be FALSE.
