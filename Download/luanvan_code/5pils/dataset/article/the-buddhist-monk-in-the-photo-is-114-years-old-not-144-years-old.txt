An image of a monk is being shared on social media with a claim that he is 144 years old. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: The Buddhist monk in the photo is 144 years old.
Fact: The monk in the photo is LP Saur Kantiko and he is 114 years old. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.  
When the image in the post was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same image was found to be uploaded on Instagram by a user with the username – ‘magie.du.bouddha’. The photo was uploaded on 23rd June 2019 and has a description – “Meeting with the very venerable lp saur kantiko (114 years) This Master exudes kindness and spirituality, I was really lucky to be able to come and see him in his temple.” On the website of ‘magie.du.bouddha’, it can be found that the person bowing to the monk is a webmaster who travels and collects the Buddhist magic amulets and objects, which he eventually sells on his website.  The same information can also be found on the Facebook page of ‘magie.du.bouddha’.
To sum it up, the Buddhist monk in the photo is 114 years old, not 144 years old.
