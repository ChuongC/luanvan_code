An image shared on Twitter claiming to show the massacre in Benshangul-Gumuz in Ethiopia is FALSE.
The image shows bodies lying on the side of the road with burning buildings in the background.
The post itself is in response to a tweet by the prime minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, urging the nation to maintain precautionary measures against COVID-19, such as wearing masks, in order to save lives and support healthcare workers.
Reports indicate that Benshangul-Gumuz, in the western region of Ethiopia, has been rocked by violence in the recent past with the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) confirming that on December 25, 2020 the death toll in the area had risen to 207.
However, the image shown does not represent the situation in Benshangul-Gumuz and was not taken in the area.
A Google reverse image search brings up a number of news articles with the same image, with information relating to a 2016 incident of violence in the town of Kasese in Uganda.
Clashes in western Uganda killed 55 people, leading to the arrest of Tribal King Charles Wesley Mumbere for allegedly inciting the community to violence.
While none of the articles by Peril of Africa, news2.onlinenigeria.com and edujandon.com have captioned the image in question, all of them refer to the violence in Kasese in 2016 between the Uganda Police Defense Force and Royal guards of Kasese District, Rwenzori of Uganda.
PesaCheck has looked into the tweet with an image claiming to show the massacre in Benshangul-Gumuz in Ethiopia, and finds it to be FALSE.
