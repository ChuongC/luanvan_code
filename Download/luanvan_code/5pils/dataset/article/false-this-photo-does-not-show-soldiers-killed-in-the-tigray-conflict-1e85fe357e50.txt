A photo in a Facebook post claiming to show dead bodies of soldiers from Ethiopia and Eritrea killed in the conflict in Tigray region is FALSE.
The writer of the post says he was forced to publish the picture after users “accused him of lying”. The post also condemns the move by Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, and Eritrea’s president, Isaias Afwerki, for sending troops into Mekelle.
It also mentions Tigrayan forces “destroyed Prosperity Party” (the ruling party in Ethiopia) on November 22, and goes on to wish victory for the people of Tigray.
As the conflict in Tigray region rages on, both the federal and regional governments have claimed victory, with the United States White House National Security Council calling for mediation led by the African Union to end the dispute.
But the photo in the post does not show what is happening in northern Ethiopia. A reverse image search shows the screengrab was taken from a 1984 American war film titled Red Dawn.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo claiming to show dead bodies of soldiers from Ethiopia and Eritrea killed in Tigray, and finds it to be FALSE.
