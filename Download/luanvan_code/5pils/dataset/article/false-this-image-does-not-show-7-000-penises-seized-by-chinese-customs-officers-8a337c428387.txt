A Facebook post with an image claiming to show over 7,000 penises from Nigeria that were seized by Chinese customs officers is FALSE.
According to the claim, the human organs were seized from a ship ferrying the consignment in Shanghai Harbour, following a tip-off from an anonymous informant. The post is accompanied by an image showing two men opening up boxes that supposedly contain the seized organs.
The post also claims that the organs were packaged in 36 boxes labelled “plantain bananas′′ and were stored inside a refrigerated container. The ship’s crew, comprising four Nigerians, two Malians and two Cameroonians, is currently in detention, the post adds.
The same claim was published in an article by Harare Live, as seen here.
Close scrutiny of the post reveals inconsistencies, raising suspicions about the authenticity of the claim. For instance, the title of the post indicates 7,000 penises were seized, but the text of the post says only seven organs were seized.
A Google reverse image search traces the original image to a Chinese customs website. The image was first published in 2020 and was taken during an operation by the Chinese customs anti-smuggling department in which suspected smuggled pangolin scales were seized in a logistics warehouse.
A report published on March 9, 2020, said that 820 kilograms of pangolin scales that had been smuggled into China, were seized during the exercise.
Reports of the seizure of the 7,000 human organs have not been published by any credible news websites.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show over 7,000 penises from Nigeria were seized by Chinese customs officers and finds it to be FALSE.
