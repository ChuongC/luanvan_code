An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) and Tigray Defense Force (TDF) fighters hugging is FALSE.
The text in Amharic shared on Facebook along with the photo showing two armed fighters on November 5, 2021, hugging translates, “Freedom seeking people. Seeing is believing. OLA + TDF”
In August 2021, OLA announced it established an alliance with TPLF with the aim of “overthrowing the government militarily”.
Similarly, on November 1, 2021, Getachew Reda, the spokesperson for the TPLF, a group fighting against the Ethiopian government, confirmed in a BBC interview the alliance.
However, PesaCheck has learnt that the image does not show OLA and TDF fighters hugging.
Google Reverse image search provides that the image, from February 2019, shows a member of the Oromia regional state police and a fighter of Oromo Liberation Front hugging, at Begi in West Wollega, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia.
The image was featured by The Finfinne Intercept, an online news platform, on February 19, 2021, and captioned, “A member of the Oromia police greets an OLF fighter back from the bushes with a brotherly embrace.”
The two officers hugged as part of the attempted mediation between the Ethiopian government and Oromo Liberation Army in February 2019. The story about the peace process was covered by the Oromia Media Network (OMN) on February 19, 2019.
PesaCheck has investigated an image shared on Facebook claiming to show OLA and TDF fighters hugging each other and finds it to be FALSE.
