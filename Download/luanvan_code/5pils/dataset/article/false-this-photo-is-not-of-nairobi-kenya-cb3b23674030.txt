A tweet, accompanied by a photo of a skyscraper supposedly depicting Nairobi, the Kenyan capital city, is FALSE.
The tweet, which was shared on 5 March 2023, comes amid an online feud between Kenyans and Nigerians under #KenyaVSNigeria on Twitter and other platforms.
The online exchange, in this case on Twitter, began after politician Bola Tinubu was declared Nigeria’s President-elect on 1 March 2023. Subsequently, internet users from Kenya began making banter at Nigerians for electing a senior citizen and doubting the capabilities of Tinubu, as seen in this tweet.
Online feuds are common, especially on Twitter, as seen in this thread. This phenomenon has been covered here, here and here.
However, the image in the tweet we are fact-checking is not of a skyscraper in Nairobi.
A Google reverse search of the image shows that the skyscraper is the Marina Bay Sands, a resort in Singapore.
Likewise, a Yandex search confirms that the building is the Marina Bay Sands.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet accompanied by a photo of a skyscraper supposedly in Kenya’s capital city, Nairobi, and found it to be FALSE.
