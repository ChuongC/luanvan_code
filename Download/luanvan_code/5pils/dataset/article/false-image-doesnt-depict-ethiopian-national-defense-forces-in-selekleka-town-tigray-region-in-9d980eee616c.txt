A Facebook post with an image purportedly of Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) in Selekleka town in the Tigray region in October 2022 is FALSE.
“A confirmed news update!” the headline of the post in Amharic shared on 19 October 2022 proclaims.
“The victory of the Ethiopian Defense Force has continued. The force has controlled Selekleka town which is located 30km away from Shire!” the post adds.
Selekleka is in northwestern Tigray region of Ethiopia.
On 19 October 2022, the BBC reported that Ethiopian federal forces had taken control of Shire, Alamata, and Korem in the northern part of Tigray.
However, the image we are looking into does not show ENDF in Selekleka as claimed.
Results of Google reverse image search indicate that the image is related to the war in the Amhara region in 2021, not Tigray.
The image was captured by AFP Photographer Amanuel Sileshi, via Getty Images in December 2021. It shows Ethiopian forces aboard a vehicle in Wuchale, Amhara regional state, on 13 December 2021, after the government forces regained many places in Tigray from Tigray forces.
PesaCheck has investigated a Facebook post with an image purportedly of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces in Selekleka in the Tigray region of Ethiopia in October 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
