This photo shared on Facebook purportedly of a man detained for defiling his two children in Nyamache, Kisii County, is FALSE.
“Kenya needs prayers. This evil father raped his two children today at Nyamache,” the post reads in part.
The photo was published at a time when Kisii county has been making headlines over increased cases of crime.
Some of the most recent cases reported in the county include this and this that happened in the first week of January 2023.
But is this photo really of a man detained in Nyamache, Kisii County?
A reverse search of the image established that it is from Malawi and not Kisii, Kenya, as alleged.
According to Malawi 24, one of the publications that published the image, the man in the photo was reportedly detained on 9 January 2023 after he was caught removing drips from cholera patients at Limbe Health Centre in Blantyre.
The publication cited Chrissy Banda, the Blantyre District Health Office spokesperson, who confirmed the incident, stating that the intention of the detainee was yet to be established.
PesaCheck has examined a photo shared on Facebook purportedly of a man detained for defiling his two children in Nyamache, Kisii County, and finds it to be FALSE.
