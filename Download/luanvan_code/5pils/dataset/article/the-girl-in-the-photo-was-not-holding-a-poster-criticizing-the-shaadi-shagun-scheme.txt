An image of a girl is being shared on Facebook with a claim that she was holding a poster criticizing the ‘Shaadi Shagun’ scheme. Let’s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.
Claim: The girl in the photo was holding a poster criticizing the ‘Shaadi Shagun’ scheme.
Fact: No, the girl was not holding a poster criticizing the ‘Shaadi Shagun’ scheme. The photo was taken in 2014 and the scheme was announced in 2017. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.  
When the image in the post was run through Google Reverse Image, it was found to be uploaded by a Facebook page called ‘Speaking Frame’ back in 2014 in an album with the title “Before judging US, JUDGE yourself!”. In the original photo, the girl was holding a poster which reads, “If a girl is in LOVE, it’s natural and it does not make her CHARACTERLESS”.
Also, when looked for the scheme ‘Shaadi Shagun’ on Google, it was found that the scheme was announced in 2017. The official press release of the government also mentions this in 2017.  So, it is clear that the girl’s photo was taken in 2014, much before the announcement of this scheme.
To sum it up, the girl in the photo was not holding a poster criticizing the ‘Shaadi Shagun’ scheme.
