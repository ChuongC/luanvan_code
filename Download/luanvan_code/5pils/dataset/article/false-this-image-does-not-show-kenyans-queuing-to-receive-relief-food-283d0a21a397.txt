A Facebook post with an image purportedly of Kenyans queuing to receive relief food is FALSE.
“Dismay in Mt. Kenya as starving and angry locals endure shame to line up in long queues for the first time ever in history to receive relief food. Barely a month after UDA promised bountiful harvests from farms… [][][]” reads the post.
The Kenyan government has partnered with relief organisations to distribute food to those affected by food insecurity in different parts of the country. The situation has been occasioned by a combination of shocks, including a fourth successive below-average rainy season, localised resource-based conflict and high food prices as a result of the war in Ukraine and low in-country production.
A Google reverse image search, however, shows that the picture in question was taken in South Africa and not Kenya. The image was shared by Human Rights Watch on 20 May 2020.
The headline reads: “South Africa: End Bias in Covid-19 Food Aid”.
“People affected by the coronavirus economic downturn, line up to receive food donations at the Iterileng informal settlement near Laudium, southwest of Pretoria, South Africa,” the accompanying caption reads.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly of Kenyans queuing to receive relief food and finds it to be FALSE.
