A post is being shared on Facebook with a claim that the person standing in front of the hut is Ashalata Devi (Captain of India’s Women Football Team). Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: Photo of Ashalata Devi standing in front of her house (a hut).
Fact: The person standing in front of the hut in the photo is not Ashalata Devi. Her name is Soni Kumar. She was India’s Under-14 women’s football team captain. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
The person on the left: Ashalata Devi
When the image on the left is cropped and ran through Google Reverse Image Search, the same image can be found in an article published by the ‘Scroll’ with the following description: ‘Indian women’s football team captain Ashalata Devi in action’. So, it can be concluded that the person in the photo is Ashalata Devi. 
The person on the right: Soni Kumari
When the image on the right is cropped and ran through Google Reverse Image Search, it was found that the person in the photo is not Ashalata Devi. In an article published by ‘India.com’ in 2016, the same photo can be found with the following description: ‘Harsh Reality! Soni Kumari, India’s Under-14 women’s football team captain is living in poverty!’. A video about Soni Kumari can also be found in the article.
To sum it up, the person standing in front of the hut in the photo is not Ashalata Devi. She is Soni Kumari.
