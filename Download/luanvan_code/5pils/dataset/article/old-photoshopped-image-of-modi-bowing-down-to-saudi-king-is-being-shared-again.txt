A post with an image of PM Modi bowing down to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is being shared on Facebook. Let’s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.
Claim: The image in the post shows Modi bowing down to touch the feet of Saudi’s King Salman.
Fact: Modi’s image of bowing down to touch the feet of Advani, back in 2013, was photoshopped to add Saudi King’s photo in Advani’s place. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the image in the post is cropped and ran through Google Reverse Image Search, newspaper article on this issue can be found in the search results.  According to the Business Standard article, Modi’s photo of bowing down to Advani, in 2013, at a rally in Bhopal has been photoshopped to place Saudi King’s photo in place of Advani. This photo went viral in 2016 when a News18 journalist has tweeted the morphed  photo. The BJP then had filed a formal complaint on the journalist for which he had apologized.
To sum it up, an old photoshopped image of Modi bowing down to Saudi king is being shared again.
