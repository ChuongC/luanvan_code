A post claiming to show “so many Eritrean soldiers in the North and West Tigray regions” is FALSE.
Three images showing armed people are attached to the Afaan Oromo post.
On 22 May 2021, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told parliament that Eritrean troops had entered the Tigray region when war broke out in November 2020.
However, Google’s reverse image search results here, here, and here reveal that the images in the claim were already online before the Tigray conflict began.
The InfoMigrant website published the first image on 9 August 2019. Its description talks of Eritrea being “increasingly militarised since the conflict with Ethiopia in 2000”. The photo is copyrighted to A. Joe of the picture-alliance/dpa.
The second image shows Eritrean soldiers returning from the Adi-Quala front line in May 2000. The photo is by Steve Forrest/EPA.
Also, the third image is by Steve Forrest and is related to the Eritrea-Ethiopia war. Its description shows Eritrean soldiers en route to the front lines in Igila, Eritrea in 2000.
PesaCheck has looked into Facebook images claiming to show that there are so many Eritrean soldiers in the North and west Tigray regions and finds it to be FALSE.
