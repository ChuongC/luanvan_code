An image post shared on Facebook claiming to show an Ethiopian Air Force drone attack on Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) troops is FALSE.
The text — in Afaan Oromo — accompanying the photo reads in part: “Current News: Yesterday, when the remaining forces of the TPLF tried to control Kobo, the Ethiopian Air Force did a wonderful job. When the TPLF group was a few kilometres away from Kobo, the Ethiopian Air Force, which monitors the enemy 24 hours a day, attacked them with a drone.”
However, Google reverse image search results indicate that the photo has been online since 2019.
The image was, for instance, shared on this website in August 2019 with a caption indicating it is of a Turkish Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicle. The photo is credited to Reuters.
The Railly News website published the picture on 27 October 2020, in the article headlined: “Turkish UAV Engines of Canadian Producing Company embargo on Turkey.”
There have been multiple reports of drone attacks in Ethiopia since the war started in the Tigray region in November 2020.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a picture claiming to be of a drone attack on TPLF forces by the Ethiopian Air Force and finds it to be FALSE.
