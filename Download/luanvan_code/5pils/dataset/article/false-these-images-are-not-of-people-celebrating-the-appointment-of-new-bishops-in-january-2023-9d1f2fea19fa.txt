This Facebook post with images purportedly of residents in different Ethiopian towns celebrating the appointment of new bishops in January 2023 is FALSE.
The Amharic post shared on 27 January 2023 reads: “People’s in different cities are expressing their happiness for the journey of the ‘new bishops’ which starts tomorrow.”
On 22 January 2023, Abune Sawiros, the Archbishop of South West Shoa, along with two other archbishops appointed 26 bishops without the endorsement of the Holy Synod of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.
The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church denounced the appointments and also excommunicated Abune and the other bishops involved in the process. On 27 January 2023, the breakaway archbishops responded by announcing that the nominee bishops would soon be dispatched to their churches.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the photo is not of residents in Ethiopia celebrating the appointment of the new bishops in January 2023.
The first image was taken from a news report posted on the Oromia Media Network (OMN) YouTube channel on 26 February 2020. The video is titled “The Welcome and discussion program of Oromia Church in West Wollega Gimbi.”
The second and third images are the same and were also taken from the video published on the OMN YouTube channel in February 2020.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with images supposedly of residents in different towns celebrating the appointment of new bishops in January 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
