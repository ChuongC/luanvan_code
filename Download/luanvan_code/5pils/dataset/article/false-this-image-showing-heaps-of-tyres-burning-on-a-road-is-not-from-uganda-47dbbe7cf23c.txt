An image that features in an article and that claims to show tyres that were set ablaze on a road in Uganda is FALSE.
The image, which was published in an article by Trumpet News website, claims to show events that happened on November 18, 2020, as supporters protested the arrest of Ugandan politician Robert Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine.
The image shows what looks like tyres being burnt on a road as a crowd looks on in the background. The photo is captioned “Bonfires have been lit in Kampala”.
On November 18, 2020, police in the capital, Kampala, fired tear gas and bullets to disperse Bobi Wine’s supporters, who blocked roads and burned tyres after news of his arrest. The leader of the National Unity Platform (NUP) party was arrested while on the campaign trail in the town of Luuka.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the photo was not taken in Uganda but in Ennerdale, a town in Gauteng, South Africa. It was first shared online in May 2017. On August 8, 2017, the South African blog, eNCA, reported that the image was taken as residents protested the lack of development in the area.
PesaCheck has looked into an article with a featured image claiming to show tyres blazing in the middle of a road in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
