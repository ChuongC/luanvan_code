An image shared on Facebook with a post claiming that Deputy President William Ruto has donated food worth Ksh87 million to the less fortunate is FALSE.
The image shows what appears to be bags of grain and oil containers among other food items arranged in rows that stretch over a large sandy area.
The post, which praises Mr Ruto for his philanthropic gesture, does not, however, say when or where he made the donation.
However, a reverse image search shows that the image was taken in The Gambia and is among other photos of the same donation taken from different angles and uploaded to Facebook in May 2019.
The post describes the food packages as having been donated by a wealthy individual and were to be distributed during the holy month of Ramadan. There is, however, no mention of how much the donation cost.
Additionally, a search on the deputy presidentâ€™s Facebook and Twitter accounts does not show the photos of the donation claimed to be from him.
PesaCheck has looked into an image of a donation claimed to be by DP Ruto and finds it to be FALSE.
