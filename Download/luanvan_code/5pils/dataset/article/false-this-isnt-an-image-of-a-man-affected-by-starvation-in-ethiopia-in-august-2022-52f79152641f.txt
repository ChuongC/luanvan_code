A Facebook post with the image claiming to be of a starving man in Ethiopia in August 2022 is FALSE.
“Where are Oromo intellectuals? Where are religious leaders? Where are influential people?” asks the post in Afaan Oromo, shared on 1 August 2022.
“Why isn’t a committee established, open a bank account and engaged in humanitarian fundraising? We are fighting over politics as we get enough food for ourselves. But our people are dying of starvation?” the post adds.
“Please don’t ignore this tragic incident and do voice for these affected people”.
The post is accompanied by an image of a malnourished man lying on the ground.
A United Nations report released late July 2022 stated that more than 50 million people in East Africa face food insecurity due to rain failure for four consecutive rainy seasons, causing severe drought.
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) Situation Report on 22 July 2022, Ethiopia is facing one of the most severe droughts in the last 40 years following four consecutive failed rainy seasons.
However, the image we are looking at does not show a person affected by hunger in Ethiopia.
Results of a Google reverse image search show that the image depicts the effects of hunger in the Karamoja sub-region of Uganda in July 2022.
The image is credited to Jim Spire Ssentongo, the KR Media in a story about Members of Parliament from the Karamoja appealing to the Ugandan Government for food aid to the households affected by severe hunger.
The image was also featured in a similar story by Pulse.ug, a Ugandan online news outlet in July 2022.
On 19 July 2022, Reuters reported the deaths of people affected by starvation due to food shortage in Karamoja.
PesaCheck has investigated a Facebook post with an image claiming to show a starving man in Ethiopia in August 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
