A Facebook post with an image claiming to be of an airstrike by the Ethiopian Air Force on Nunu Kumba town, East Wollega, is FALSE.
The Afaan Oromo post translates to; “On 22 October 2022, today Many innocent citizens were killed and many were injured in the government airstrike in East Wollega Nunu Kumba district.”
Nunu Kumba is one of 180 woredas (districts) in Ethiopia’s Oromia region, which is part of East Wollega Zone.
There are reports of an airstrike by the federal government forces in which dozens of civilians were killed in the town of Mendi, Mana Sibu district of West Wollega in Oromia, in November 2022.
However, Google reverse image search results established that the photo is unrelated to the Ethiopian war.
The Naval Technology website published the picture on 10 July 2019, in an article, “US Navy’s MQ-8C Fire Scout unmanned helicopter ready for operations.” The caption reads: “The MQ-8C Fire Scout unmanned helicopter conducting a flight test at Naval Air Patuxent River Webster Field Annex in Saint Inigoes, Maryland. It is credited to US Navy”
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of an Ethiopian Air Force attack on Nunu Kumba town at East Wollega and finds it to be FALSE.
