A post on Facebook with a couple of pictures claim that while Bose was establishing Azad Hind Fauz, RSS was saluting the British Queen. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.
Claim: RSS pracharaks giving the guard of honour to the British Queen
Fact: The image has been photoshopped. RSS pracharaks were not giving the guard of honour to the British Queen. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When the images in the post are cropped appropriately and ran through Google Reverse Image Search, the actual photos can be found in the respective search results. When the RSS pracharaks picture is cropped and searched, the original photo can be found in a Deccan Chronicle newspaper article. In the original photo, there is no Queen standing in front of the pracharaks.
 If the walking Queen portion is cropped and searched, the original photo was found in a tweet posted by HistoryVille. The original photo was taken when Queen Elizabeth II was inspecting the Nigerian Army during her visit to Nigeria in 1956.
To sum it up, RSS pracharaks were not giving the guard of honour to the Queen. It’s a photoshopped image.
