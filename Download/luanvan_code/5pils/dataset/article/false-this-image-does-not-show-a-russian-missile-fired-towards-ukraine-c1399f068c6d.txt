This image shared on Facebook claiming to show a missile fired by Russia towards Ukraine is FALSE.
The post in Amharic translates, “So far, the Russian military has fired 400 missiles at its target in Ukraine. There is no indication that Belarus will send its troops to Ukraine, according to Pentagon’s senior official.”
On 28 February 2022, the Guardian published a report citing a United States defence official indicating Belarus’ intention to deploy its troops to back Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the image attached to support the claim has no relation to the current Ukraine-Russia conflict.
For instance, the image was published on the Noticias de Israel website in 2019, and its description from Google translate reads, “Neptune missile defence system”. The photo is credited to Alisa Biryukova.
The same image was shared on the Defence Blog website on 5 April 2019 in an article, “Ukraine successfully tests Neptune anti-ship missile defence system.” The picture was also published on the WeapoNews website on the same date as seen here.
PesaCheck has looked into the image shared on Facebook claiming to show a missile fired towards Ukraine by Russia and found it to be FALSE.
