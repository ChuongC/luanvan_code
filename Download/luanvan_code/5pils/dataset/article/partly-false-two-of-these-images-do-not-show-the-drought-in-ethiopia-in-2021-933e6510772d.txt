A Twitter post portraying a severe drought in Borana, Ethiopia and castigating the government over its alleged failure to provide assistance to victims is PARTLY FALSE.
“The Ethiopian government is not providing any assistance to the starving and thirsty people of Borana. But we must reach out to them. Humanity is above everything. It’s easy to imagine how hard it would be if we can’t access water for a minute,” the post in the Amharic and English languages states.
The post uses four images to support its claim. However, Google reverse image search results, as seen here and here, show that two of the images have previously been used between 2015 and 2016.
The first image was used in an article by the New York Times website titled, “Ethiopia, a Nation of Farmers, Strains Under Severe Drought” on 18 October 2015. The article is about drought in northern Ethiopia.
The second image was published on the Quartz Africa website on 16 May 2016. The article discusses floods and their resultant displacement of people and death of livestock. The description of the image states that it shows a cow in Gelcha village, Oromia region of Ethiopia.
On the other hand, Google, TinEye, and Yandex reverse image searches yield no results for the third image. Similarly, the fourth image is not found on Google, TinEye, and Yandex reverse image searches.
A drought in Borana has reportedly caused the deaths of more than 7,000 cattle. Reports indicate that thousands of people are affected by malnourishment.
PesaCheck has looked into a Twitter post with images portraying a severe drought in Borana, Ethiopia and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.
