A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a political rally by the Azimio la Umoja — One Kenya Alliance in Nyeri County is FALSE.
The image shows an aerial view of a mammoth crowd stretching far on what appears to be a countryside landscape.
“AZIMIO STRONG MAMMOTH ZONED IN NYERI RALLY,” reads the Facebook post accompanying the image.
The image was shared on 5 July 2022, when Raila Odinga, the presidential candidate for Azimio la Umoja — One Kenya Alliance hosted campaign rallies in Nyeri County. However, none of the images shared by Odinga bears any resemblance with the image in question.
A reverse image search provides a number of articles containing the image. One of them is by Getty Images. According to the caption, the image was taken in August 1969 and is credited to Getty Images photographer Barry Z Levine.
It shows an aerial view of the stage and the 500,000-strong crowd gathered at the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair in Bethel, New York.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show a political rally by the Azimio la Umoja — One Kenya Alliance in Nyeri and found it to be FALSE.
