A Facebook image claiming to show a drone attack in Wollega in the Oromia region of Ethiopia is FALSE.
“Operation ‘Abdissa Aga’. In Limmu and Sasiga East Wolleg district of the Oromia region, there was a coordinated attack, under the name ‘Operation Abdissa Aga’, on the terrorist Shene and the robber’s group. More than 250 key members of the terrorist group were reportedly killed in the attack. The attack will intensify,” the post in Amharic reads.
To advance this claim, an image of a drone is included in the post. However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo has been shared on different websites since 2016, and it is not related to the attack in the Wollega.
On 29 October 2016, the Defense World website published the image. According to its description, the image, also shared on the Afghan Online Press website on 16 September 2017, shows a US MQ-9 Reaper drone. The image was used on other websites, as seen here, here, and here. The US Air Force is credited as the source here.
On 29 November 2021, PesaCheck debunked a claim in which the picture was used in a claim purporting to show an attack on Tigray forces.
The Oromia Media Network has reported an airstrike in Wollega, the Oromia region, citing Odaa Tarbii’s Tweet as a source. Odaa is the international spokesperson for the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). The Ethiopian government designated OLA a terrorist group.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook image claiming to show a drone attack in Wollega, the Oromia region and finds it to be FALSE.
