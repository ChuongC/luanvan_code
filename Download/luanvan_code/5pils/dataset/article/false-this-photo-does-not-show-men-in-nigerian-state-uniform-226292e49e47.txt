This tweet with an image published on January 25, 2021, claiming to show men in Nigerian State Uniform going around killing innocent Nigerians in their homes is FALSE.
The post has been retweeted over 700 times since it was published.
But the truck in the image bears ‘GK’ on the number plate, which is the registration of government vehicles in Kenya.
A Google reverse Image search shows that this photo was first published in 2013. The image features in both international and local news media, including Today Online and the Toronto Star.
The image shows Kenyan soldiers patrolling near the Westgate Mall following an attack by Al Shabaab on September 21, 2013, in Nairobi, Kenya. The image is credited to Sayyid Azim of Associated Press (AP).
PesaCheck has looked into the tweet with an image claiming to show men in Nigerian State Uniform going around killing innocent Nigerians in their homes and finds it is a HOAX.
