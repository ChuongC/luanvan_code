An image shared on Facebook claiming to show an attack on the Tigray force training centre at Indabaguna area is FALSE.
The text accompanying the photo in Amharic translates, “The Ethiopian Air Force has taken action against a terrorist training center and fuel tanks in a Tigray region called Indabaguna area.”
Indabaguna is located in the Tigray region, about 551 kilometres north of the capital, Addis Ababa.
However, Google reverse image search results show that the MasrAlarabia website published it on 26 March 2015, before the Tigray conflict began in November 2020.
The website published the image alongside an article that reads, “Saudi airstrikes target air defenses at “Al-Daylami Air” Base.”
Different websites have published the photo as seen here, here, here, and here.
Northern Ethiopia has experienced armed conflict since November 2020, when the federal government sent troops to Tigray, accusing the region’s ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), of staging an attack on the Federal Army base.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show an attack on the Tigray force training centre at Indabaguna area and finds it to be FALSE.
