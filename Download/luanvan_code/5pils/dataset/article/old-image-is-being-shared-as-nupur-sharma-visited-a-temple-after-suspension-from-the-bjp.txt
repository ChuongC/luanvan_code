In light of the Prophet remarks row, a social media post accompanying an image of BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma performing rituals in a temple is being widely shared with a claim that the image shows Nupur Sharma‚Äôs recent visit to a temple after being suspended from the party. Through this article, let‚Äôs fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Recent image from Nupur Sharma‚Äôs visit to a temple after suspension from the party.
Fact: The image is actually from Nupur Sharma‚Äôs visit to Ujjain temple. She shared the same image on her twitter account on 29 April 2022 whereas she was suspended from the BJP on 05 June 2022, which proves the image is related to her temple visit much before her suspension.¬† Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
Earlier on 27 May 2022, speaking in a TV debate, BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma made controversial remarks on Prophet Muhammad. And eventually following a global outrage, she has been suspended from the party on 05 June 2022.
However, the image shared in the post is from her temple visit in Ujjain on 29 April 2022, almost a month before she made those controversial remarks. Reverse image search of the photo shared in the post led us to a tweet by Nupur Sharma, through which she shared the same image.

Further, we could not find any reports of Nupur Sharma visiting any temple after being suspended from the party.
To sum it up, an old image is being shared as Nupur Sharma visiting a temple after suspension from the BJP.
