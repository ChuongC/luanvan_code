This picture posted on Facebook purporting to be of a Ugandan father of eight from Masaka district in a gay marriage in Canada is FALSE.
“Mukiibi Fred, a father of six girls and two sons from Masaka has officially gotten married in Canada. This thing is getting serious…,” the writer says and attaches two pictures.
A similar claim was shared here, with the writer adding: “If you know his kids tell them that Taata wamwe empapula awo wezimutusiza”, loosely translated as; “This is where the need for papers has landed your father”.
PesaCheck performed a Google reverse image search and found that the man in the picture is not a Ugandan. This article, published in 2021 by the Zambian Observer, states the black man in the picture is Wayne Mulenga, who was officially married in a ceremony in Manchester, United Kingdom.
In the article are pictures and a video of Mulenga proposing to the partner.
Another website in Malawi published the pictures on 24 October 2021.
PesaCheck has looked into a picture on Facebook purportedly of a Ugandan from Masaka in a gay marriage in Canada and finds it to be FALSE.
