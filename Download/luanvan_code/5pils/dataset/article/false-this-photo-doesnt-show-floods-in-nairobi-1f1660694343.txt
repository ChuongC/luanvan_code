This post on X (formerly Twitter), with a photo supposedly of a flooded road in Nairobi, Kenya is FALSE.
The image shows cars submerged on the road after what seems to have been a heavy downpour.
“Where are the boats which Johnson Sakaja bought? Nairobi is flooded yet someone pocketed El Nino money! Time to prepare for Babu Owino in 2027,” reads the post.
Different parts of Kenya continue to experience heavy rainfall in November 2023, but does the photo show the situation in Nairobi?
Google reverse image search results on the photo established that it was taken in Mombasa and not Nairobi, Kenya.
According to NTV Kenya, the image depicts a flooded road in Kibarani, Mombasa County. The publisher watermarked the image, thus indicating that they originally captured it.
The authentic image was also published here and here.
