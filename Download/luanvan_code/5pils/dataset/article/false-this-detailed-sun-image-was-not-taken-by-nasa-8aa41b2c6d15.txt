A tweet with an image claiming to show the clearest view of the sun taken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is MISLEADING.
The post is captioned, “The clearest picture of the sun from NASA” and has over 5,000 retweets and 38,000 likes.
However, a reverse image search shows that the picture was neither captured nor shared by the US space agency. The image was created by astrophotographer Jason Guenzel, and is a ‘heavily’ software-processed image — an excellent work of work of ‘science and art.’
Further research led us to the website Fine Art America, which is an online art market.
The image was uploaded online by Jason Guenzel on January 16, 2021, with the caption, “Magnetic Sun: A stylized rendition of a solar close-up. This image highlights the turbulent magnetic field on the visible surface of our star.”
Mr Guenzel captured the image on December 10, and shared it to his Twitter, Facebook and Instagram account in early January. He writes in his posts that it is a “heavily software-processed image.”
The photographer’s post on Facebook and Instagram reads, “This session on the Sun was marred by sub-par atmospheric conditions leaving a loss of contrast and detail. I took this opportunity to heavily process the resulting image into a stylized rendition of the visible surface of the sun.”
On Reddit, the astrophotographer explained how he created the sun’s image using photos collected through his backyard solar telescope.
PesaCheck has looked into a tweet with an image claiming to show the clearest view of the sun taken by NASA and finds it to be MISLEADING.
