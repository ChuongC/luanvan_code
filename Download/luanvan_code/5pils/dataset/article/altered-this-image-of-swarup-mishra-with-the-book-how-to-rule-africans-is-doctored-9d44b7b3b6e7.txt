A photo shared on Twitter claiming to show Kesses Member of Parliament Swarup Mishra with a book titled ‘How To Rule Africans’ on his desk is ALTERED.
The photo shows the legislator seated behind his desk, a computer in front of him, and a stack of books to his right amongst stationery.
The book in question is part of a stack and rests below a book titled ’48 Law of Power’ and above another titled ‘Cascades.’
The text accompanying the post suggests this is why Kenyan patients seeking treatment at Mediheal Group of Hospitals are mistreated. Dr Mishra is the founder and chairman of the group.
The post further calls on Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi to deport the legislator.
An internet search brings up a post with a similar image, among two others shared on Dr Mishra’s official Facebook page on August 27.
The photo caption explains that Dr Mishra was chairing a departmental committee meeting in his role as vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Health.
The photo shows the same stack of books but only one has a title — Cascades; the other titles were doctored to insert the titles.
PesaCheck has looked into a photo claiming to show Kesses Member of Parliament Swarup Mishra with a book titled “How to Rule Africans” on his desk, and finds it to be ALTERED.
