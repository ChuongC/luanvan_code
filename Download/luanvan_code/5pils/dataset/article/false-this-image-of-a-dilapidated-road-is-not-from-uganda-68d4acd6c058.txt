A Facebook post with an image of a dilapidated road and text claiming that it shows the Nyendo-Masaka Road in Uganda is FALSE.
The post is captioned ‘Steady Progress’, and claims that the image is of the road which connects Masaka to Bukakkata and Kalangala Islands in Buganda region of Uganda.
The image has also been published on Twitter with the same claim.
However, a Google reverse image search shows the image is from Zimbabwe and was first shared in 2016. The image features on a number of blogs, including SA-News.com, New Zimbabwe and OldgitsFunnies.
The Nyendo-Masaka Road often features in the news in Uganda due to its poor state, a situation that has sparked demonstrations by residents on several occasions.
However, a September 2020 report in the Daily Monitor says that the government has released UGX 35.9 billion for the rehabilitation of the road.
The minister of Works, General Katumba Wamala, has also confirmed that the Masaka-Bukakata Road is being upgraded and will be paved. Further, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) has announced the signing of contracts for the construction of roads in Masaka City where the alleged road in the claim is found.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image showing a dilapidated road and claiming that this is the Nyendo-Masaka Road in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
