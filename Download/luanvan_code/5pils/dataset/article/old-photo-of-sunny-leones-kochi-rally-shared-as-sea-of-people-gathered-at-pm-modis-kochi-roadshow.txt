A photo of a white car engulfed in a massive crowd is being shared on social media with a claim that it is a photo taken during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent Kochi visit. Let’s verify the claim made in this photo.
Claim: A photo of a massive crowd gathered on the roads of Kochi during PM Modi’s visit in April 2023.
Fact: This photo is from 2017 and was captured when Bollywood actress Sunny Leone visited Kochi to inaugurate a mobile store. Hence the claim made in the post is False.
Although huge crowds greeted PM Modi during his recent roadshow in Kochi, we found this photo to be unrelated to it. To learn the details behind this viral photo, we performed a reverse image search on Google, which led us to multiple news articles (here and here) from 2017 which contained this photo.
Reportedly, Bollywood actress Sunny Leone visited Kochi to inaugurate a mobile phone store in August 2017, and a huge crowd gathered there to get a glimpse of her. The actor even posted the same image on her Twitter and thanked everyone.
PM Narendra Modi held a roadshow in Kochi on 24 April 2023, and supporters gathered on the sides of the road where he walked and greeted them. More visuals can be seen here and here.
To sum up, an old photo of Sunny Leone’s Kochi rally is peddled as a sea of people captured during PM Narendra Modi’s Kochi roadshow.
