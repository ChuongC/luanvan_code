A Facebook post with an image of Kenyan President William Ruto clad in a National Resistance Movement (NRM) branded shirt is ALTERED.
The photo is of Ruto dressed in a shirt with the logo of the NRM, the ruling party in Uganda.
A Google reverse image search shows that the image is altered. The original image, as seen here, here and here, shows Ruto in a plain shirt.
Kenya’s ruling United Democratic Alliance party, like Uganda’s NRM, uses yellow as its colour of identity.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image showing Kenyan President William Ruto dressed in a National Resistance Movement (NRM) party branded shirt and finds it to be ALTERED.
