An image is being shared on social media claiming it as a beautiful painting of Raja Ravi Verma. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.
Claim: Image showing a beautiful painting of Raja Ravi Verma.
Fact: The image shared in the post shows a photoshoot picture clicked by a Karnataka-based photographer named Nagendra Mayya. This image does not show a painting and it has nothing to do with Raja Ravi Verma. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
On reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, a similar photo was found published on an Instagram page named ‘nmclicks’, on 30 August 2021. This is the Instagram handle of a Karnataka-based photographer, Narendra Mayya. He mentioned it as a photoshoot picture depicting Yashoda and Krishna. Narendra Mayya photography offers themed or creative candid photoshoots of weddings, newborn babies, travel, birthday parties, and couple and baby photoshoot. Narendra Mayya photography had also shared this photograph on their Facebook page.
Similar candid photoshoot pictures of babies were found on the ‘nmclicks’ Instagram handle. Several prominent baby-oriented Instagram handles like ‘babies. Galaxy’ and ‘babies. Enthusiasts’ have shared the same photograph crediting it to Narendra Mayya’s photography. They can be seen here and here. From all these pieces of evidence, it can be concluded that the image shared in the post shows a photoshoot picture, not the painting of Raja Ravi Verma.
To sum it up, a photoshoot picture depicting Yashoda and Krishna is falsely shared as a beautiful painting of Raja Ravi Verma.
