This Facebook post with an image supposedly of members of the Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) who attacked Fano from eastern Amhara in April 2023 is FALSE.
The post, in Amharic, translates to; “The terrorist Fano of Eastern Amhara wing, led by Mere Wodajo is being beaten by the Ethiopian [national] defence army. Victory for our defence forces.”
Fano is an armed youth movement in the Amhara regional state.
Protests erupted in the Amhara region in April 2023 after the government ordered regional forces to integrate into either the federal military or the police.
On 12 April 2023, VOA reported that “local fighters briefly took over a police station and seized weapons amid ongoing clashes between protesters and the military in Mezzezo town, Amhara region”.
Yandex image search results, however, established that the picture used to advance the claim is unrelated to the conflict between the Ethiopian defence forces and armed groups in the Amhara region.
The image is among pictures used to accompany an Amharic poem posted on the FDRE National Defense Force’s official Facebook page in November 2020.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image purportedly of members of the Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) who attacked Fano fighters from eastern Amhara in April 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
