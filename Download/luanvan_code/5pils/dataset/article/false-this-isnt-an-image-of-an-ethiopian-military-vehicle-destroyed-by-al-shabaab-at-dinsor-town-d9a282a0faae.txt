A Facebook post with a picture claiming to show an Ethiopian military vehicle destroyed by Al Shabaab at Dinsor town, Somalia, in 2022 is FALSE.
Dinsor is a town in the Bay region of Somalia.
The post in English reads, “AlShabaab fighters claim to have killed 11 Ethiopa|n soldiers, injured 7 others and destroyed a military vehicle following an ambush near Dinsor town in Somalia’s Bay region. No comment from the Ethio govt yet.”
Al Shabaab is a militant organisation fighting to oust the Somali government and the foreign military presence supporting it.
Ethiopia is one of the contributing countries to the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.
However, Google reverse image search results reveal that the photo claiming to show an Ethiopian military vehicle destroyed by Al Shabaab in 2022 is untrue.
The Long War Journal website published the picture on 19 June 2015, in an article titled, “Al Shabaab releases images from the ambush of Ethiopian troops.” The image is credited to Al Shabaab’s Al Kataib Media.
The image was also posted on the Tesfa News website on 19 January 2019, with a description that reads, “Ethiopia’s military to unleash a massive military offensive against AL-Shabaab terror groups in Somalia a day after dozens of its troops reportedly killed in an ambush.”
PesaCheck has looked into a Twitter post with an image claiming to show an Ethiopian military vehicle destroyed by Al Shabaab at Dinsor town, Somalia, in 2022 and finds it to be FALSE.
