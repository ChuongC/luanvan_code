This Facebook post with an image supposedly of Eritrean troops close to the Sudanese border after fighting started in Khartoum in April 2023 is FALSE.
Sudan is at war with itself due to power struggle between the country’s military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.
The Amharic text accompanying the picture translates to; “Breaking news! Eritrea moved its army closer to the border of Sudan. Due to the war in Sudan, Eritrea has recently moved several troops to the Sudanese border called Kassala. Kasala is currently administered by Sudan, but there are those who believe that Kasala historically belonged to Eritrea. The Sudanese are saying that Eritrea has deployed its army to forcefully invade Kassala. Sources said that Eritrea has moved its troops to secure its border.”
However, Google reverse image search results show that the BBC published the photo on 11 September 2018. The British broadcaster’s description of the photo reads: “Eritrean troops arrived at the Zalambessa border for the reopening ceremony.”
PesaCheck has examined a Facebook post with an image supposedly of Eritrean troops near the border with Sudan after fighting broke out in Khartoum in April 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
