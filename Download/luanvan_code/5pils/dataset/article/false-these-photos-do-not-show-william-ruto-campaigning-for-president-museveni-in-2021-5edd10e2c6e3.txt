A Facebook post that claims the embedded images show Kenya’s Deputy President William Ruto campaigning for Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni recently is FALSE.
The post contains three images of Mr Ruto addressing Ugandans while in the company of President Yoweri Museveni. In the photos, Ruto is seen waving and shaking hands with individuals who surrounded a vehicle he is in.
However, a Google reverse image search shows that the images are not from recent times and have been used before.
A search on TinEye shows that the photo has been online since 2015 and appears to have first emerged during Mr Ruto’s visit to Uganda that year.
During the 2015 visit, Mr Ruto discussed three issues with President Museveni, including the Kapchorwa Road linking the two countries, the problem of cross-border cattle rustling involving various communities in Kenya and Uganda and the need to preserve the forest around Mt Elgon that cuts across the border.
Similar images also featured in news articles in Kenya, including Nation, Tuko and Kenyans.co.ke.
A further search shows a video published by NTV Uganda taken in 2015 during the same event at Kapchorwa Municipal grounds in Uganda.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show recent images of Deputy President William Ruto campaigning for Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on the last leg of his 2021 campaigns and finds them to be FALSE.
