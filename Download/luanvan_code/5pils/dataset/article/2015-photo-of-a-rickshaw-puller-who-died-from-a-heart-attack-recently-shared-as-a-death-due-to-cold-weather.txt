A photo of a man leaning on a seat in the back of a Rickshaw is being shared on social media claiming that he died recently due to cold weather conditions. Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.
Claim: Image of a Rikshaw puller who died recently due to the cold weather.
Fact: The viral photo has been circulating on social media since 2015. It is reported that a Rickshaw puller had lost his life due to a heart attack near Patna airport. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.
To know whether the claim that the man in the photo lost his life due to the cold weather is true, we performed a reverse image search on it. This led us to multiple old social media posts that contained the same image. These posts (here and here) shared this photo with a similar claim. While looking through the posts containing the same photo, we found a post by a Facebook user named Shubham Shekar. He uploaded a clearer version of the viral photo in December 2015.
According to Shubham’s post, an old Rickshaw puller lost his life due to a Heart Attack, and this incident occurred near Patna airport. This photo was also posted by a Delhi-based Media Organisation called National News Story in December 2015. They mentioned that the old man in the photo died from a heart attack near Patna airport.
To sum it up, a 2015 photo of a Rickshaw puller who died from a heart attack is being shared as a recent death due to cold weather conditions.
