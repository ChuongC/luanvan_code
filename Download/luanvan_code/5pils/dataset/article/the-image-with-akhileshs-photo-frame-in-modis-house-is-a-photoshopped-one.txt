Many Facebook users are sharing a post with an image of Akhilesh Yadav’s photo frame (Ex-Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh) in Narendra Modi’s house. Let’s try to analyze the veracity of the claim made in the post.
Claim 1: Akhilesh Yadav’s photo frame was hung on a wall in Modi’s house.
Fact: The actual photo frame seen in Modi’s house is that of Lord Sri Krishna and Rukmini. It is replaced with that of Akhilesh Yadav’s through image editing technique and put in the post. Hence the claim is FALSE
On doing Google Reverse Image search, the picture in the post was found to be the one taken recently when Narendra Modi visited his home to seek his mother’s blessings, before voting in the ongoing General Elections-2019. Several media houses have covered this event. The original photo can be seen in the NEWS18 article, published on April 23, 2019. The photo frame seen hanging on the wall in the picture is that of Lord Sri Krishna and Rukmini. This photo is photoshopped and replaced with that of Akhilesh Yadav.
To sum it up, the photo frame hung to a wall in Modi’s house is not that of Akhilesh Yadav’s. It is the photo frame of Lord Sri Krishna and Rukmini.
