A Facebook post with an image claimed to be of lions sleeping outside a public toilet at a national park in Uganda is FALSE.
The author names Kidepo Valley National Park in Uganda as the park.
However, the photo, which resurfaced on Facebook with the claim, was previously online as seen here and here.
Google reverse image search shows that the image was taken at Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and not in Uganda. The image, as seen here and here, has been online since 2018.
PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to be of lions sleeping outside a public toilet in a national park in Uganda and finds it to be FALSE.
