Vaccination Certificate is wrongly shared as Death Certificate with PM Modi’s image - FACTLY

A photo accompanying a post is claimed to be an Online Death Certificate containing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image. Let us fact-check the claim made in the post.
Claim: Online Death Certificate is branded with PM Modi’s image.
Fact:  The photo accompanying the post contains a COVID-19 vaccination certificate, not a death certificate. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.
When reverse image search of the image is performed, it takes us to a news article, where the same image is available. The image available here is of a better resolution. On observing carefully, one can easily realize that it is a provisional certificate for COVID-19 vaccination. As per the article, taking a dig at PM Modi for the increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country, Maharashtra Minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik demanded that if Modi’s photo is printed on vaccination certificates, then his photo should also be put on death certificates. The inclusion of PM Modi’s photo on vaccination certificates has been a controversy from the beginning.
According to the image, the vaccination of the person was done in Delhi. The image has the photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with the exhortations in English (“Together we will defeat Covid-19”) and Hindi (“davai bhi aur kadai bhi”, “medicines as well as rigour”).
Hence, the photo accompanying the post is not an online death certificate, but a COVID-19 vaccination certificate with the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
