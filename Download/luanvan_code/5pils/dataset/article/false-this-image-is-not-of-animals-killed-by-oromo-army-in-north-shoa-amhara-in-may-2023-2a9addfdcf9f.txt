This Facebook post with an image supposedly of animals killed by the Oromo army in Ethiopia’s North Shoa, Amhara region, in May 2023 is FALSE.
The post, in Amharic, translates to; “Animals slaughtered by the Oromo extremist defence army in North Shoa.”
The photo has cattle on the ground as bystanders look on.
PesaCheck reviewed the image in the post and found no connection with activities in the Amhara region in May 2023.
A Google reverse image search established that the picture was shared online years before May 2023.
The Gozamin Woreda communication affairs Facebook page published the image on 22 October 2019, alongside a text on cattle injured in a traffic accident in Gambo district, South Wollo Zone.
The image was also published on 22 October 2019 in this Facebook post about the accident in Gambo district.
In early April 2023, the decision by the Ethiopian federal government to disarm regional forces and volunteer civilian militia sparked protests and clashes in the northern part of the Amhara region.
PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with an image supposedly of slaughtered animals killed by the Oromo army in Ethiopia’s North Shoa, Amhara region, in May 2023 and finds it to be FALSE.
