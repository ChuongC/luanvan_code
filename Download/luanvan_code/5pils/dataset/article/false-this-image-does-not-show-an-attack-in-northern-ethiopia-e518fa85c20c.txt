A Facebook post with an image claiming to show an attack in the northern parts of Ethiopia is FALSE.
The Amharic text accompanying the picture translates as; “Breaking information. Today, our heroic Air Force has inflicted heavy losses on the enemy on three fronts. The Air Force launched a successful attack on the Adigrat, Raya, and Barahle front.”
But results from a Google reverse image search showed that the picture is unrelated to the war in Ethiopia.
The photo is found in this video uploaded on YouTube on 10 May 2022. The video was headlined, “Ukraine lost 80 Bayraktar TB2 attack drones in two and a half months.”
The same image was shared on this website. Results from Google translate indicated that the headline stated, “Turkey delivers 20 ‘Bayraktar TB2’ drones to the UAE.”
The claim photo was also posted on this Twitter account on 22 September 2022. This tweet contains the link to the above article with its title.
Different actors are trying to end the war in Ethiopia. The African Union plans to stage peace talks between the Tigray forces and the federal government of Ethiopia in South Africa. The talks have been delayed due to logistical reasons. Meanwhile, the fighting continues.
PesaCheck has examined the Facebook post with an image claiming to show an attack in northern Ethiopia and finds it to be FALSE.
